---

## Stage 4: Mastery

- Manage fatigue and attention
- Self-check before submission

**Exercises:**
- Full proof simulation (30–50 pages, timed)
- Accuracy tracking across long sessions
- Final checklist discipline

---

## Assessment Approach

### Grading

Each exercise graded on:
- **Accuracy:** errors caught ÷ total errors (target: 98%)
- **Precision:** correct marks ÷ total marks (avoiding false positives)
- **Time:** completion within target (tracked, benchmarked)
- **Consistency:** same treatment of same issues throughout

### Mastery Gates

- Must achieve 95%+ accuracy to progress from Stage 2 to Stage 3
- Must achieve 98%+ accuracy to progress from Stage 3 to Stage 4
- Must achieve 98%+ at viable speed to complete Stage 4

### Remediation

- Weak areas identified automatically
- Targeted exercises assigned until mastery demonstrated
- No time limit on remediation (mastery over speed)
