## Stage 1: Spelling & Typos
**Days 1–2**

### Learning Content (Email)

**Day 1: Seeing Errors**
- Reading vs proofing (different brain modes)
- Scanning techniques: slow, deliberate, pattern-matching
- Common typo patterns: transpositions, omissions, doublings
- British spelling conventions (-ise/-ize, -our/-or, -re/-er)

**Day 2: Homophones & Proper Nouns**
- Homophones that spell-check misses (their/there, its/it's, led/lead)

### Test: Stage 2 Gate

**Format:** 2 pages of fiction with dialogue, seeded punctuation errors  
**Errors seeded:** 20  
**Pass threshold:** 18/20 correct (90%), max 2 false positives  
**Time limit:** 15 minutes  

**Fail:** Repeat with different test passage.

---

## Stage 3: Consistency & Style Sheets
**Days 5–6**

### Learning Content (Email)

**Day 5: Tracking Consistency**
- What to track: names, places, terms, timeline
- Building a style sheet as you proof
- Spotting variants (grey/gray, realise/realize within same text)
- Character consistency (physical descriptions, relationships)

**Day 6: The Working Style Sheet**
- Style sheet format and organisation
- Recording decisions as you make them
- Using the style sheet to catch later inconsistencies
- Handing over a style sheet that's actually useful

### Practice Exercises (Web)

- Exercise 3.1: Find the inconsistencies (passage with 10 variant spellings)
- Exercise 3.2: Build a style sheet (proof 3 pages, create style sheet)
- Exercise 3.3: Timeline check (spot chronological errors)
- Exercise 3.4: Character consistency (spot description contradictions)

### Test: Stage 3 Gate

**Format:** 5-page passage with consistency errors + style sheet creation  
**Errors seeded:** 15 consistency errors  
**Pass threshold:** 14/15 caught (93%), usable style sheet submitted  
**Time limit:** 25 minutes  

**Fail:** Repeat with different test passage.

---

## Stage 4: Integration
**Days 7–8**

### Learning Content (Email)

**Day 7: Putting It Together**
- Managing cognitive load: multiple error types simultaneously
- Systematic approaches: how many passes?
- Stamina and focus over pages
- The discipline of not rewriting

**Day 8: Queries and Judgment**
- When to fix silently vs query
- Writing useful queries (brief, neutral, helpful)
- Knowing your limits: when to escalate
- The proofreader's role: invisible, not authorial

### Practice Exercises (Web)

- Exercise 4.1: Full chapter proof, all error types (10 pages)
- Exercise 4.2: Query practice (5 ambiguous cases, write queries)
- Exercise 4.3: Timed chapter proof (10 pages, 30 minutes)

### Test: Stage 4 Gate

**Format:** 10-page chapter with mixed error types  
**Errors seeded:** 30 (spelling, punctuation, consistency mix)  
**Pass threshold:** 29/30 correct (95%), max 3 false positives  
**Time limit:** 35 minutes  

**Fail:** Repeat with different chapter.

---

## Stage 5: Speed & Final Assessment
**Days 9–10**

### Learning Content (Email)

**Day 9: Speed Without Sacrifice**
- Finding your pace: speed/accuracy threshold
- Techniques for faster scanning
- Managing time across a proof
- When to slow down (dialogue, names, numbers)

**Day 10: Professional Standards**
- What "done" looks like
- The handover: clean proof, usable style sheet
- Self-checking before submission
- Your ongoing development

### Practice Exercises (Web)

- Exercise 5.1: Speed drill (5 pages, 12 minutes)
- Exercise 5.2: Speed drill (5 pages, 10 minutes)
- Exercise 5.3: Full simulation (15 pages, 40 minutes)

### Test: Final Assessment

**Format:** 15-page proof, full manuscript conditions  
**Errors seeded:** 40 (realistic density and distribution)  
**Pass threshold:** 39/40 correct (98%), max 3 false positives  
**Time limit:** 45 minutes  
**Style sheet:** Must be submitted, must be usable  

**Fail:** May repeat once. Second fail → return to Stage 4 for remediation.

---

## Grading Criteria

### Accuracy Score
- **Catches:** Errors correctly identified ÷ Total errors seeded
- **False positives:** Marks on correct text (penalised)
- **Formula:** (Catches - False Positives) ÷ Total Errors = Score

### Style Sheet (Stages 3–5)
- Completeness: all variants recorded
- Organisation: findable, logical
- Accuracy: no incorrect entries

### Time
- Tracked but not failed for (until Stage 5)
- Stage 5: must complete within time limit

---

## Progression Rules

1. **No skipping:** Stages must be completed in order
2. **No partial credit:** Below threshold = not passed
3. **Unlimited attempts:** Different test passages each time
4. **No time penalty:** Take as long as needed to master (within the 2-week window)
5. **Chat support available:** Ask Diana during practice, not during tests

## Failure Modes & Remediation

| Pattern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Consistent typo misses | Extra spelling exercises, different techniques |
| Dialogue punctuation errors | Focused dialogue module, more practice |
| Consistency blind spots | Style sheet drills, systematic tracking practice |
| Speed but no accuracy | Slow down, rebuild from Stage 4 |
| Accuracy but no speed | Timed drills, incremental pressure |

---

## Support Model

### During Practice
