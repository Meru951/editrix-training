# Nudge System v2 — Behavioural Approach

*Kind but firm. Setting them up for success.*

---

## Principles

1. **Frame quitting as the unappealing choice** — nobody wants to think of themselves as a quitter
2. **Give them agency** — let them choose to continue (choosing feels powerful)
3. **Remind them why they started** — reconnect to their original motivation
4. **Make continuing easy** — remove friction, one clear action
5. **Never shame** — disappointment is fine, shame backfires

---

## During Exercises: Real-Time Feedback

Students DO get feedback on each exercise so they can learn and improve:

- Correct answers: Brief confirmation, maybe a tip
- Wrong answers: Explanation of why, link to relevant lesson section
- Stage tests: Detailed breakdown of what they got right/wrong

**The goal:** Mastery at each stage before moving on.

## The Nudge Sequence

### 12 hours: Gentle Reminder

**Subject:** Day [X] is waiting for you

---

Hi [Name],

Just a quick note — Day [X] is ready when you are.

Most people find it takes about an hour. The lesson's short, the exercises are hands-on, and you'll feel good when it's done.

**[Continue where you left off →]**

### 24 hours: The Choice

**Subject:** Shall I save your spot?

---

Hi [Name],

I noticed you haven't started Day [X] yet. 

I know life gets busy — truly, I do. But I want to be honest with you: this programme works best when you stay in rhythm. Each day builds on the last. Fall behind, and it gets harder to catch up.

So I have a question for you:

**Are you still in?**

If yes — great. [Start Day [X] now →] and you'll be back on track within the hour.

If now genuinely isn't the right time, that's okay too. Reply and let me know, and I'll pause your enrolment. No hard feelings. You can restart when life allows.

What I can't do is wait indefinitely. I need you to decide.

### 48 hours: The Identity Appeal

**Subject:** [Name], a quick word

---

[Name],

I've noticed you've gone quiet, and I wanted to reach out personally.

When you signed up, you said you wanted to learn proofreading. That took initiative. Most people just think about doing things — you actually started.

I don't know what's getting in the way right now. Maybe work exploded. Maybe energy dipped. Maybe you opened the lesson and felt overwhelmed. All of that is normal.

Here's what I know: **people who finish things are people who finish things.** That's the difference between someone who talks about becoming an editor and someone who actually becomes one. It's not talent. It's follow-through.

You have one more day to get back on track. After that, I'll need to close your enrolment — not because I'm punishing you, but because this programme only works for people who are actively doing it.

**[Complete Day [X] now →]** — it'll take an hour.

Or reply and tell me you need to stop. I'll respect that.

But silence isn't an option I can work with.

### 72 hours: Final — The Off-Ramp

**Subject:** Decision time

---

[Name],

This is my last message before I close your enrolment.

I've sent a few notes over the past few days. I haven't heard back. I understand — sometimes that's the answer in itself.

If you want to continue, this is the moment: **[Complete Day [X] now →]**

If you've decided this isn't for you — or if life has genuinely made it impossible right now — just reply with "I'm out" and I'll close things cleanly. No judgement. You can reapply in a month if circumstances change.

I hope you come back. I think you could do this. But I need you to choose.

Diana

---

### Auto-Close (84 hours, no response)

No email sent. Enrolment quietly closed.

If they return later and try to log in, they see:

---

**Your enrolment has ended.**

You can reapply in 30 days if you'd like to try again.

## The Psychology

| Nudge | Technique |
|-------|-----------|
| 12h | Low pressure, remove friction ("just an hour") |
| 24h | Give them choice + agency ("Are you still in?") |
| 48h | Identity appeal ("people who finish things...") |
| 72h | Clear deadline + graceful exit ("just say 'I'm out'") |
| Close | No shaming, door left open |

**Key insight:** Asking "Do you want to quit?" makes quitting feel active and uncomfortable. Most people will choose to continue just to avoid thinking of themselves as quitters.

## Positive Nudges (When They're Doing Well)

Not all nudges are for falling behind. Encourage momentum too:

**After completing a day on time:**

> Day [X] done — and on time. That's the rhythm. See you tomorrow.

**After passing a stage test:**

> Stage [X] complete. You're [X]% of the way through. Keep going.

**Halfway point (after Day 5):**

> You're halfway through. Most people who make it to Day 5 finish the whole thing. You're in good company.

**After Day 9:**

> One day left. Tomorrow is your final assessment. You've done the work — now you prove it.

---

## If They Come Back After Falling Behind

They reach out after 48+ hours of silence:

---

**Subject:** RE: their message

---

[Name],

Good to hear from you.

Here's where you stand: you're [X] days behind. To complete the programme, you'll need to finish [remaining days] in [remaining time].

That's doable if you commit to it. Here's what I suggest:

1. **Today:** Complete Day [X] (the one you missed)
2. **Tomorrow:** Complete Day [X+1]
3. **Then:** Back to normal rhythm

If you can do that, you're still on track.

**[Pick up where you left off →]**

Let's finish this.

## Summary

- **Feedback during exercises:** Yes — so they learn
- **Grades during programme:** No — only at completion
- **Nudge tone:** Kind, identity-based, offers choice
- **Ultimate message:** "I believe you can do this, but you have to choose"
- **No shaming:** Ever

*Behavioural psychology > harsh warnings*
