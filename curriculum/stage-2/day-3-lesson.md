# Day 3: Core Punctuation
## Stage 2: Punctuation & Dialogue

---

You've proved you can spot spelling errors. Now we tackle punctuation — the skeleton that holds sentences together.

---

## Why Punctuation Matters

A missing comma can change meaning. Consider:

- "Let's eat, Grandma." (invitation to dine)
- "Let's eat Grandma." (cannibalism)

Your job is to ensure the author's intended meaning survives to the printed page.

## Commas

### The Oxford Comma

In a list of three or more items, the Oxford comma is the comma before "and":

- With: "apples, oranges, and bananas"
- Without: "apples, oranges and bananas"

**New Hart's Rules:** Use the Oxford comma. It prevents ambiguity.

Consider: "I love my parents, Batman and Wonder Woman."  
Are your parents superheroes? The Oxford comma clarifies: "I love my parents, Batman, and Wonder Woman."

**Your job:** Check that the manuscript is consistent. If it uses Oxford commas, every list should have one. If it doesn't, none should.

### Comma Splices

A comma splice joins two independent clauses with just a comma:

- Wrong: "She opened the door, the room was empty."
- Right: "She opened the door. The room was empty."
- Also right: "She opened the door, and the room was empty."
- Also right: "She opened the door; the room was empty."

**Your job:** Catch comma splices. They're errors.

### Restrictive vs Non-Restrictive

This is subtle but important.

**Restrictive clause** (no commas): Essential information that defines the noun.
- "The man who wore the red hat left early."
- (Which man? The one in the red hat. The clause is essential.)

**Non-restrictive clause** (with commas): Additional information that could be removed.
- "The man, who was wearing a red hat, left early."
- (The man is already identified. The hat detail is extra.)

**Tip:** "Which" usually gets commas. "That" usually doesn't.
- "The book that she recommended was excellent." (restrictive)
- "The book, which she recommended, was excellent." (non-restrictive)

### Which vs That: The Full Rule

In British English, "which" for restrictive clauses is acceptable but increasingly, style guides prefer:
- **"that"** for restrictive (no comma): *"the book that I read"*
- **"which"** for non-restrictive (with comma): *"the book, which I enjoyed, was long"*

**The test:** Can you remove the clause and still have a complete, meaningful sentence?
- Yes → non-restrictive → "which" with commas
- No → restrictive → "that" without commas

**Watch for:** "which is" or "which was" without a preceding comma. This often signals a restrictive clause that should use "that."

- Wrong: "The car which was red drove past."
- Right: "The car that was red drove past." (restrictive — which car?)
- Also right: "The car, which was red, drove past." (non-restrictive — we already know which car)

## The Missing "That"

Some sentences omit "that" and remain grammatical but become unclear:

- "I think I should go." ✓ (clear)
- "I noticed the door was open." → Could be clearer as: "I noticed that the door was open."

**When to consider querying:**
- If the sentence feels choppy or ambiguous
- After verbs like: *think, know, feel, realise, notice, hope, suspect*

This isn't always an error — sometimes omitting "that" sounds more natural. Use judgment. If readability suffers, query it.

---

## Semicolons

A semicolon joins two related independent clauses:

- "She loved the city; he preferred the country."

Both parts must be complete sentences. If you replaced the semicolon with a full stop, both parts would still work.

**Common error:** Semicolon before a conjunction.
- Wrong: "She loved the city; but he preferred the country."
- Right: "She loved the city, but he preferred the country."

---

## Colons

A colon introduces something: a list, an explanation, or an elaboration.

- "She needed three things: courage, patience, and luck."
- "He knew what he had to do: run."

**Rule:** The part before the colon must be a complete sentence.

- Wrong: "She needed: courage, patience, and luck."
- Right: "She needed three things: courage, patience, and luck."

## The Big Three: Hyphen, En-Dash, Em-Dash

These are different marks with different uses. Getting them right matters.

### Hyphen (-)

**Use for:**
- Compound adjectives before nouns: "a well-known author"
- Prefixes in some cases: "re-examine", "co-worker"
- Word breaks at line ends

**Keyboard:** The key next to 0.

### Compound Adjectives: The Key Rule

This trips up even experienced writers. Learn it well.

**Before a noun → hyphenate:**
- "a 12-year-old child"
- "a well-known author"
- "a pony-tailed girl"
- "a decision-making process"

**After a noun → no hyphen:**
- "the child is 12 years old"
- "the author is well known"
- "the girl was pony tailed"

**The test:** Is the compound coming *before* the noun it modifies? If yes, hyphenate.

**Common errors:**
- "a 12 year old child" → should be "12-year-old"
- "ponytailed" → should be "pony-tailed" when modifying a noun
- "a well known author" → should be "well-known"

**Exception:** Adverbs ending in -ly don't take hyphens:
- "a badly written report" (no hyphen — "badly" is clearly an adverb)
- "a well-written report" (hyphen — "well" could be misread)

### En-Dash (–)

**Use for:**
- Ranges: "pages 10–25", "1990–2000", "Monday–Friday"
- Relationships between equal elements: "the London–Paris train"

**Width:** The width of the letter N.

### Em-Dash (—)

**Use for:**
- Interruption or parenthetical: "She was going to—but then she stopped."
- Setting off a phrase with more emphasis than commas: "The truth—and he knew this—was hard to accept."

**British style (New Hart's):** Space on either side: "The truth — and he knew this — was hard to accept."

**Width:** The width of the letter M.

**Common error:** Using hyphens where dashes are needed.
- Wrong: "pages 10-25" (hyphen)
- Right: "pages 10–25" (en-dash)

## Apostrophes

### Possessives

- Singular: "the dog's tail"
- Plural: "the dogs' tails" (more than one dog)
- Irregular plural: "the children's toys" (children is already plural)

**Names ending in S:** Add 's for singular.
- "James's book", "Charles's letter"

### Contractions

- "it's" = "it is" or "it has"
- "you're" = "you are"
- "they're" = "they are"

### Plurals

**Apostrophes do not make plurals.**

- Wrong: "apple's for sale"
- Right: "apples for sale"

Exception: single letters ("mind your p's and q's") and sometimes numbers/abbreviations for clarity.

## Today's Practice

Log in to the training portal:

- **Exercise 2.1:** Comma correction (20 sentences)
- **Exercise 2.2:** Dash decisions (15 items: choose hyphen, en-dash, or em-dash)

Complete both before tomorrow's lesson on dialogue punctuation.

## Key Takeaways

1. Oxford comma: use it, or at least be consistent.
2. Comma splices are errors. Two independent clauses need more than a comma.
3. Semicolons join complete sentences without a conjunction.
4. Hyphen, en-dash, em-dash: three different marks, three different uses.
5. Apostrophes show possession and contraction. Never plural.
