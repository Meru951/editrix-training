# Day 4: Dialogue Punctuation
## Stage 2: Punctuation & Dialogue

---

Fiction lives in dialogue. Get this wrong, and the whole manuscript looks amateur. Get it right, and you're invisible — which is exactly what a proofreader should be.

## British Dialogue: Single Quotation Marks

**British standard:** Use single quotation marks for speech.

- British: 'Hello,' she said.
- American: "Hello," she said.

New Hart's Rules uses single quotes. Your manuscripts should too.

---

## The Basic Pattern

**Speech + speech tag:**

'I'm leaving,' she said.

Note:
- Comma inside the closing quote
- Lowercase "she" (it's part of the same sentence)

**Speech tag + speech:**

She said, 'I'm leaving.'

Note:
- Comma after "said"
- Full stop inside the closing quote

---

## Speech Tags vs Action Beats

This is where most errors occur. Learn the difference.

### Speech Tag

A speech tag tells us who's speaking and how: *said*, *asked*, *whispered*, *shouted*, *replied*.

**With a speech tag, use a comma:**

- 'I'm tired,' he said.
- 'What time is it?' she asked.
- 'Get out!' he shouted.

Note: Questions and exclamations keep their marks, but still lowercase for the tag.

### Action Beat

An action beat is a separate sentence describing what the character does.

**With an action beat, use a full stop:**

- 'I'm tired.' He rubbed his eyes.
- 'What time is it?' She looked at her watch.
- 'Get out!' He pointed at the door.

Note: Full stop (or question mark or exclamation mark) inside the quote. Capitalise the action because it's a new sentence.

### The Test

Can you replace the tag/beat with "he said"?

- "He rubbed his eyes" → "he said"? No. It's an action beat. Use a full stop.
- "he muttered" → "he said"? Yes. It's a speech tag. Use a comma.

### Common Errors

Wrong: 'I'm tired,' he rubbed his eyes.  
(You can't "rub" words. This needs a full stop.)

Right: 'I'm tired.' He rubbed his eyes.

Wrong: 'I'm tired.' He said.  
(Said is a speech tag. This needs a comma.)

Right: 'I'm tired,' he said.

## Interrupted Speech

### Em-Dash for Interruption

When speech is cut off by someone or something else:

- 'I was just about to—'
- 'But I never said—' He grabbed her arm.

Note: No space before the em-dash. No closing punctuation before it.

### Ellipsis for Trailing Off

When the speaker loses the thread or hesitates:

- 'I thought maybe we could...'
- 'It's just that...' She paused. 'Never mind.'

**British style:** Three dots, often with a space before the closing quote.

---

## Nested Quotes

When quoting within dialogue, switch to double quotes:

- 'She said, "I'm leaving", and walked out.'

**British pattern:** Single outside, double inside.
**American pattern:** Double outside, single inside.

---

## Dialogue Across Paragraphs

If a character's speech continues for multiple paragraphs:

- Open quotes at the start of each paragraph
- Close quotes only at the end of the final paragraph

Example:

'I want to tell you something important. Something I've never told anyone before.

'When I was young, I made a mistake. A terrible mistake that I've regretted ever since.

'And now I need your help to make it right.'

Note: No closing quote after the first and second paragraphs. Closing quote only after the final paragraph.

---

## Punctuation Inside or Outside?

**British style (New Hart's):** Punctuation goes inside quotes only if it belongs to the quoted material.

- She described it as 'extraordinary'.  
  (The full stop is the narrator's, not the quoted word's.)

- 'Is it over?' she asked.  
  (The question mark belongs to the speech, so inside.)

**Exception in dialogue:** Terminal punctuation for direct speech always goes inside:

- 'I'm leaving.'
- 'Are you coming?'
- 'Stop!'

## Stage 2 Test: Tomorrow

You'll receive 2 pages of fiction with dialogue, seeded with 20 punctuation errors.

**To pass:** Catch at least 18 of 20 errors, with no more than 2 false positives.

**Time limit:** 15 minutes.

## Key Takeaways

1. British dialogue uses single quotation marks.
2. Speech tags (said, asked, whispered): use a comma.
3. Action beats (he walked, she nodded): use a full stop.
4. Em-dash for interruption; ellipsis for trailing off.
5. Multi-paragraph speech: open quotes on each paragraph, close only at the end.
6. Nested quotes: single outside, double inside.
