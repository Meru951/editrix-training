# New Hart's Rules Alignment Audit

## Issues Found in Current Curriculum

### ❌ CRITICAL: Dash Usage (Day 3)

**What I taught:**
> Em-dash with spaces: "The truth — and he knew this — was hard"

**What Hart's actually says:**
- Use **spaced en-dash** for parenthetical dashes: "The truth – and he knew this – was hard"
- Em-dash (—) is American style
- British style uses en-dash (–) with spaces either side

**Files to fix:** Day 3, Day 4, exercises, test passages

---

### ❌ Date Format (Simulation passage)

**What I wrote:**
> "4th July 1923"

**What Hart's says:**
- No ordinal suffixes in dates: "4 July 1923" not "4th July"
- Day Month Year (no commas)

**Files to fix:** Simulation passage, any examples with dates

---

### ⚠️ Hyphenation: "no-one" vs "no one"

**Current:** Used "no-one" (hyphenated)

**Hart's preference:** "no one" (two words) — though both are acceptable, Hart's leans toward open compound

---

### ⚠️ Compound words

**Current:** "house-maid"

**Hart's:** "housemaid" (closed compound) — many compounds have closed over time

Need to verify each compound against current dictionary (OED)

---

### ✓ Correct: Single quotation marks for dialogue
### ✓ Correct: Logical punctuation placement  
### ✓ Correct: -ise/-ize both acceptable (consistency key)
### ✓ Correct: Oxford comma optional but recommended

## Hart's Rules for Fiction - Key Points

### Dashes in Fiction

1. **Spaced en-dash** for parenthetical: 
   > She knew – and this was the hard part – that he was lying.

2. **Unspaced em-dash** for interrupted speech:
   > 'I was going to—'
   > 'Don't,' she interrupted.

3. **En-dash** for ranges:
   > pages 45–67, 1920–1930

### Ellipsis

Hart's: Three points with thin spaces or no spaces:
- Trailing off: 'I thought maybe...'
- Omission in quoted text: with spaces around

### Numbers

Spell out:
- One to one hundred
- Round numbers (two hundred, three thousand)
- At start of sentence (always)

Use figures:
- Exact numbers over 100
- Ages in technical contexts
- Dates, times, measurements

### Quotation marks with punctuation

British/Hart's (logical placement):
- Comma/period outside unless part of quote
- Question/exclamation inside if part of quote

Exception: In fiction dialogue, closing punctuation always inside:
- 'Hello,' she said. (comma inside — speech)
- She called it 'rubbish'. (period outside — narrator's sentence)

## Corrections Required

| File | Issue | Current | Correct |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| Day 3 | Dash type | em-dash with spaces | en-dash with spaces |
| Day 4 | Interrupted speech | Verify em-dash usage | Em-dash for interruption OK |
| Simulation | Date format | 4th July | 4 July |
| Various | Compounds | Verify each | Check OED |

---

## Action Plan

1. Fix Day 3 lesson: correct dash guidance
2. Fix simulation passage: correct date format
3. Audit all examples for dash usage
4. Create reference card for Hart's vs Chicago
