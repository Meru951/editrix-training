# Day 1: Seeing Errors
## Stage 1: Spelling & Typos

---

Welcome to your first day of proofreading training. By the end of this fortnight, you'll be able to proof fiction manuscripts with confidence and accuracy. Let's start with the foundation: seeing errors.

---

## Reading vs Proofing

Here's the first thing to understand: reading and proofing are different activities. They use different parts of your brain.

When you read, your brain is hungry for meaning. It skips ahead, fills in gaps, corrects errors automatically without telling you. That's why you can read a sentence with a missing word and not notice — your brain supplies it.

When you proof, you need to slow that down. You're not reading for story. You're scanning for error. Every letter matters. Every punctuation mark.

**The shift:** Move from "what does this mean?" to "is every character correct?"

## Scanning Techniques

### 1. Slow Down

Your first instinct will be to read at normal speed. Resist it. Proofing speed is perhaps a third of reading speed, sometimes slower. You're not being inefficient — you're being thorough.

### 2. Use a Pointer

Some proofreaders use a pen or finger to track along the line. This forces your eye to move deliberately rather than jumping ahead. Try it. If it helps, use it.

### 3. Read Backwards (Sometimes)

For a final spelling check, try reading the last word first, then the second-last, and so on. This breaks meaning completely and forces you to see each word in isolation. It's slow, but it catches what forward reading misses.

### 4. Read Aloud (In Your Head)

Subvocalising — hearing the words in your mind — slows you down and catches awkward constructions, missing words, and repeated words that the eye skips.

## Common Typo Patterns

Typos aren't random. They follow patterns. Learn the patterns, and you'll spot them faster.

### Transpositions

Letters swapped: *teh* for *the*, *freind* for *friend*, *becuase* for *because*

These happen because fingers don't always fire in the right order. Your eye slides past them because the shape of the word is roughly right.

### Omissions

Letters missing: *tomorow* for *tomorrow*, *ocurred* for *occurred*, *begining* for *beginning*

Doubled consonants are the usual victims. If a word should have a double letter, check it.

### Doublings

Letters repeated: *the the*, *and and*, *untill* for *until*

Word doublings often happen at line breaks or page turns. The eye skips back without noticing.

### Wrong Letter

Adjacent keys: *woth* for *with* (o next to i), *tge* for *the* (g next to h)

## British Spelling

You're proofing to New Hart's Rules, which means British English. Here are the patterns to internalise:

### -ise vs -ize

Both are acceptable in British English, but you must be **consistent throughout the manuscript**. New Hart's Rules permits -ize (the Oxford spelling), but many British publishers prefer -ise. 

**Your job:** Check what the manuscript uses and ensure consistency. If it's *realise* on page 3, it must be *realise* on page 47.

### -our vs -or

British: *colour*, *favour*, *honour*, *behaviour*  
American: *color*, *favor*, *honor*, *behavior*

**Your job:** These should all be -our in British English.

### -re vs -er

British: *centre*, *theatre*, *metre*  
American: *center*, *theater*, *meter*

**Your job:** These should all be -re in British English.

### -ce vs -se

British English distinguishes:
- *practice* (noun) vs *practise* (verb)
- *licence* (noun) vs *license* (verb)
- *advice* (noun) vs *advise* (verb)

American English uses *practice* and *license* for both.

**Your job:** Check that nouns end in -ce and verbs end in -se.

## Double Spaces

A quick one: in modern typesetting, there's always **one space** after a full stop, never two.

Double spaces are a legacy of typewriters. They create visible "rivers" of white space running through text. Your eye can learn to spot them — they look slightly off.

**Technique:** Use Find & Replace to check ("  " → " "), but also train yourself to notice them while reading.

---

## Today's Practice

Log in to the training portal. You'll find:

- **Exercise 1.1:** Spot the typo (20 single sentences)
- **Exercise 1.2:** British vs American (15 corrections)

Complete both before tomorrow's lesson. Use the chat if you're stuck — I'm here to help.

## Key Takeaways

1. Proofing is not reading. Slow down.
2. Typos follow patterns: transpositions, omissions, doublings, wrong letters.
3. British spelling: -our, -re, -ise (consistent), -ce/-se noun/verb distinction.
4. When in doubt, check. When certain, check anyway.

*Tomorrow: Homophones and proper nouns — the errors spell-check can't catch.*
