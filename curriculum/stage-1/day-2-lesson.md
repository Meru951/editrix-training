# Day 2: Homophones & Proper Nouns
## Stage 1: Spelling & Typos

---

Yesterday you learned to see typos. Today we tackle the errors that spell-check misses: homophones and proper nouns.

## What is New Hart's Rules?

Throughout this course, we follow **New Hart's Rules** — the Oxford style guide for British English. Published by Oxford University Press, it's the standard reference for spelling, punctuation, and style in British publishing. When we say "British spelling" or "British style," we mean the conventions in this guide: *-ise* or *-ize* spellings (either is acceptable, but be consistent), *-our* endings (*colour*, *favour*), and single quotation marks for dialogue. You don't need to own the book to complete this course — we'll teach you the essentials — but know that it's our authority when questions arise.

## The -ise/-ize Question

This confuses everyone. Here's the simple rule:

**Both *-ise* and *-ize* are correct in British English.** New Hart's Rules actually prefers *-ize* (the Oxford spelling), but many British publishers use *-ise*. Neither is wrong.

**Your job as a proofreader:** Check what the manuscript uses on the first instance, then ensure consistency throughout. If page 3 has *realise*, page 47 must also have *realise* — not *realize*.

Don't change an author's preference. Just make it consistent.

## Homophones: The Spell-Check Blind Spot

A homophone is a word that sounds like another word but is spelled differently. Spell-check can't help you because both spellings are valid words — just not the right word.

### The Dangerous Dozen

Memorise these. They appear constantly, and they're missed constantly.

| Wrong | Right | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| it's | its | The dog wagged *its* tail. (possessive, no apostrophe) |
| its | it's | *It's* raining. (it is) |
| their | there | Put it over *there*. |
| there | their | *Their* house is blue. |
| they're | their/there | *They're* coming. (they are) |
| your | you're | *You're* late. (you are) |
| whose | who's | *Who's* there? (who is) |
| lead | led | She *led* the group. (past tense of lead) |
| affect | effect | The rain will *affect* the match. (verb) |
| effect | affect | The *effect* was immediate. (noun) |
| principal | principle | A matter of *principle*. (rule/belief) |
| stationary | stationery | Writing paper is *stationery*. (with an e for envelope) |

### How to Catch Them

You can't spot homophones by shape — the wrong word is spelled correctly. You have to read for meaning.

When you see these words, pause. Ask: is this the right one?

**Trick:** Substitute the full form.
- *it's* → "it is" — does the sentence still work?
- *you're* → "you are" — does the sentence still work?
- *they're* → "they are" — does the sentence still work?

If not, you've found an error.

## Proper Nouns: Consistency Over Correctness

In fiction, you'll encounter invented names: people, places, things. There's no dictionary to check against.

Your job is not to know how to spell "Kaetherine" or "Thornwood Manor." Your job is to ensure it's spelled the same way throughout.

### The Challenge

An author writes a name slightly differently and doesn't notice:
- Katherine, Katharine, Catherine, Catheryn
- Greystone, Graystone, Grey Stone
- O'Brien, O'Brian, OBrien

Each variant might appear only once. You need to catch that it differs from the established spelling.

### The Solution: The Style Sheet

As you proof, keep a running list of:
- Character names (and relationships)
- Place names
- Invented terms, titles, organisations
- Any word with unusual spelling

First instance sets the standard. Every subsequent instance must match.

We'll cover style sheets properly in Stage 3. For now, here's what a basic style sheet looks like:

### Mini Style Sheet Example

```
CHARACTERS
- Eleanor Ashworth (protagonist) — NOT Elinor, NOT Elanor
- Mrs Patterson (housekeeper) — no full stop after Mrs
- Lady Margaret (great-aunt, deceased)

PLACES  
- Hartley Hall (capital H for Hall)
- the village (lowercase)

SPELLING
- grey (not gray)
- travelled (double l)
- realise (not realize) — using -ise throughout
```

That's it. Simple. Just record what you see, and check against it as you read. We'll practise building these properly in Stage 3.

### Common Traps

**Names with variants:** Is it *Lizzie* or *Lizzy*? *Steven* or *Stephen*? The author may not have been consistent.

**Titles:** Is it *Dr* or *Dr.*? *Mrs* or *Mrs.*? British style typically omits the full stop for contractions (where the last letter is present). So: *Dr*, *Mrs*, *Mr*, *St* — but *Prof.*, *Rev.* (where the abbreviation doesn't end with the final letter of the full word).

**Place names:** Real places have correct spellings. Check them. Is it *Edinborough* or *Edinburgh*? *Gloustershire* or *Gloucestershire*?

## When to Query

Sometimes you'll find something that might be an error or might be intentional.

**Fix silently if:**
- It's clearly a typo (*teh* → *the*)
- It contradicts the established style (*Katherine* appears 50 times, *Katharine* appears once)

**Query if:**
- You're not sure which is correct (*the character's age seems to contradict the timeline*)
- It might be intentional (*the author uses "alright" throughout — is this deliberate?*)
- Changing it would affect meaning

A query is a polite question, not a correction. We'll practise writing queries in Stage 4.

## Before and After: A Marked-Up Proof

Here's what your work looks like in practice:

**BEFORE (manuscript with errors):**
> The nieghbourhood had changed considerbly over the years. Where once their had been open fields, now stood rows of identcal houses.

**AFTER (your markup):**
> The ~~nieghbourhood~~ [neighbourhood] had changed ~~considerbly~~ [considerably] over the years. Where once ~~their~~ [there] had been open fields, now stood rows of ~~identcal~~ [identical] houses.

Four errors caught: two transpositions (*nieghbourhood*, *identcal*), one omission (*considerbly*), one homophone (*their/there*).

This is what you're training to do. By the end of Stage 1, you'll spot these automatically.

## Today's Practice

Log in to the training portal:

- **Exercise 1.3:** Homophone traps (15 sentences with homophone errors)
- **Exercise 1.4:** Mini-paragraph practice (5 short paragraphs, 2-3 errors each)
- **Exercise 1.5:** Full paragraph proof (3 longer paragraphs, 6-7 errors each)

Start with 1.3 and 1.4. If you're comfortable, try 1.5. Tomorrow, take the Stage 1 test.

---

## Stage 1 Test: Tomorrow

You'll receive a 2-page passage with 20 seeded errors (typos, spelling, homophones).

**To pass:** Catch at least 18 of 20 errors, with no more than 2 false positives (marking correct text as wrong).

**Time limit:** 15 minutes.

If you don't pass, you'll receive a different passage to try again. There's no penalty for retakes — mastery is the goal.

## Key Takeaways

1. Homophones sound right but look wrong. Read for meaning.
2. *It's/its*, *their/there/they're*, *your/you're*, *led/lead* — learn them.
3. Proper nouns: first instance sets the standard. Track everything.
4. British titles: *Dr*, *Mrs*, *Mr* (no full stop for contractions).
5. Query when uncertain. Fix when certain.
