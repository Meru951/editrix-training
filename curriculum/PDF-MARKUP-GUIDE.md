# PDF Markup for Proofreaders: A Complete Guide

## Why PDF?

When you proofread a manuscript, you're not working on the author's Word document. You're working on **the proof** — a PDF that shows exactly how the book will look when printed.

**This matters because:**

1. **What you see is what prints.** Word documents reflow when you change fonts or margins. PDFs don't. The line breaks, page breaks, and layout you see in the PDF are final.

2. **You're checking the typesetter's work.** Someone has already formatted this manuscript. Your job is to catch errors they introduced — and errors that slipped through earlier stages.

3. **Your marks go back to the typesetter.** They'll open your marked-up PDF and make corrections. If your marks aren't clear, they'll make mistakes. If your marks are ambiguous, they'll have to guess — and guesses cause errors.

**The proof stage is the last line of defence before printing.** Every error you miss will be printed thousands of times.

## Why Colour Conventions?

Professional publishing uses colour to signal intent:

| Colour | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Red/Pink** | Correction | You're certain this is wrong and must be fixed |
| **Yellow** | Query | You're asking a question — needs author/editor decision |
| **Blue** | Comment/Note | Information only — not a correction request |

**Why this matters:**

A typesetter scanning your PDF will prioritise red marks — those are definite fixes. Yellow marks go to the editor for a decision. If you mark everything in red, you're making decisions that aren't yours to make. If you mark everything in yellow, nothing gets fixed efficiently.

**The discipline of colour is the discipline of judgment.**

## Setting Up Adobe Acrobat Reader DC

Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is free and industry-standard. Here's how to set it up for proofreading.

### Step 1: Open the Comment Toolbar

1. Open your PDF
2. Go to **View → Tools → Comment → Open**
3. The Comment toolbar appears on the right side

Alternatively: Press **Ctrl+Shift+C** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+C** (Mac)

### Step 2: Understand the Tools

The Comment toolbar has several tools. You'll use these constantly:

| Tool | Icon | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Highlight** | Marker pen | Mark text that needs attention |
| **Strikethrough** | ABC̶ | Mark text for deletion |
| **Replace Text** | ABC̶ + caret | Mark text to be replaced with something else |
| **Insert Text** | Caret (^) | Mark where new text should be added |
| **Sticky Note** | Speech bubble | Add a comment in the margin |
| **Text Box** | T in box | Add visible text directly on the page |

### Step 3: Set Your Colours

Right-click on any tool to change its colour:

- Set **Highlight** to **Pink** (for corrections) or **Yellow** (for queries)
- Set **Strikethrough** to **Red**
- Set **Sticky Notes** to **Yellow** (for queries) or **Pink** (for correction explanations)

## How to Mark Common Corrections

### Deleting Text

**Situation:** "the the cat" — doubled word

**How to mark:**
1. Select the extra "the " (include the space)
2. Click **Strikethrough** (or press **D** for the keyboard shortcut in some versions)
3. The word appears with a red line through it

**What the typesetter sees:** A strikethrough means "delete this."

---

### Inserting Text

**Situation:** "I went the shop" — missing word

**How to mark:**
1. Click where the text should be inserted (between "went" and "the")
2. Click **Insert Text** (the caret tool ^)
3. Type the missing word: "to"

**What the typesetter sees:** A caret with "to" — means "insert this here."

---

### Replacing Text

**Situation:** "recieve" — spelling error

**How to mark:**
1. Select "recieve"
2. Click **Replace Text** (strikethrough with caret)
3. Type the correct spelling: "receive"

**What the typesetter sees:** "recieve" crossed out, with "receive" indicated as the replacement.

---

### Transposing (Swapping) Text

**Situation:** "only I" should be "I only"

**How to mark:**
1. Add a **Sticky Note** next to the text
2. Write: "Transpose: should read 'I only'"
3. Highlight the affected text

**Why a sticky note?** The Replace tool works for simple swaps, but for transposition, a clear written instruction prevents confusion.

---

### Closing Up Space

**Situation:** "some thing" should be "something"

**How to mark:**
1. Select the space between "some" and "thing"
2. Use **Strikethrough** on the space
3. Or: Add a **Sticky Note**: "Close up: 'something'"

---

### Adding a Space

**Situation:** "Itook" should be "I took"

**How to mark:**
1. Click between "I" and "t"
2. Use **Insert Text**
3. Type a space (or write "#" which traditionally means "insert space")

---

### Raising a Query

**Situation:** You're not sure if "programme" should be "program" — it depends on house style.

**How to mark:**
1. Highlight the word in **Yellow**
2. Add a **Yellow Sticky Note**
3. Write: "AU: 'programme' or 'program'? Please confirm house style."

**Why "AU"?** This means "Author Query." Other common codes:
- **ED:** Editor Query
- **STET:** Leave as is (ignore previous mark)
- **?:** Needs clarification

## The Three-Pass Method

Don't try to catch everything in one read. Use three passes:

### Pass 1: Read for Sense
Read the page without marking. Understand what the text is saying. Flag anything that confuses you mentally.

### Pass 2: Mark Errors
Go through slowly. Mark each error as you find it. Use the appropriate tool and colour.

### Pass 3: Check Your Marks
Review every mark you made:
- Is it clear what I want?
- Would a stranger understand this?
- Is the colour correct (red for corrections, yellow for queries)?
- Did I accidentally mark something that's actually correct?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Marking Style Choices as Errors
"Gray" vs "grey" — both are correct. Check the house style before marking.

### 2. Unclear Replacement Text
Don't write: "Fix this"
Do write: "Change 'accomodate' to 'accommodate'"

### 3. Marking in the Wrong Place
Your mark should be **exactly** where the error is. If you highlight the wrong word, the typesetter will change the wrong thing.

### 4. Forgetting the Margin Note
In-text marks (like strikethroughs) need corresponding margin notes for complex changes. The typesetter scans the margins first.

### 5. Over-Marking
If you mark 50 things on one page, you're probably over-reaching. Proofreading is not copy-editing.

## Saving Your Work

### Save Regularly
Press **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac) every few pages.

### File Naming
Save as: `[OriginalName]_PROOFED_[YourInitials]_[Date].pdf`
Example: `LostSouls_Chapter1_PROOFED_VG_01Feb2026.pdf`

### Exporting Comments (Optional)
If asked to provide a comment summary:
1. Go to **Comment → Export All Comments**
2. Save as an FDF or XFDF file

## Practice Exercise

Open the practice PDF provided. Find and mark:

1. Two spelling errors (use Replace Text)
2. One missing word (use Insert Text)
3. One doubled word (use Strikethrough)
4. One query about a style choice (use Yellow Highlight + Sticky Note)

Save your marked-up PDF and submit it for feedback.

## Summary: The Proofreader's Mindset

1. **You are the last defence.** Every error you miss goes to print.
2. **Clarity is kindness.** Your marks must be unambiguous.
3. **Colour signals intent.** Red = fix this. Yellow = question.
4. **You mark, you don't rewrite.** Stay in your lane.
5. **When in doubt, query.** It's better to ask than to guess wrong.
