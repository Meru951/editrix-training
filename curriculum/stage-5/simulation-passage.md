## CHAPTER ONE

The morning of the 4th July 1923 broke hot and cloudless over Whitmore House. Eleanor Ashworth—Miss Ashworth to the staff—stood at her bedroom window, watching the gardeners prepare for that evenings party.

'It will be a dreadful crush,' she said to no-one in particular. 'Two hundred guests in this heat.'

Behind her, Mary the house-maid was laying out dresses on the bed. Three of them: the blue silk, the cream linen, and a grey chiffon that Eleanor had never worn.

'Will you wear the blue, Miss?' Mary asked.

'I haven't decided.' Eleanor turned from the window. 'Tell me, Mary—have you seen anything strange in the house lately?'

Mary's hands paused on the fabric. 'Strange, Miss?'

'Doors left open that should be closed. Objects moved from where they were left.'

'I couldn't say, Miss.' But her voice wavered.

## CHAPTER TWO

The gardens at Whitmore House stretched for three acres. Beyond them lay the park, and beyond that, the village of Thornley—home to four hundred souls who had lived there for generations.

Eleanor walked through the formal gardens, past the fountain that her grandfather had commissioned in 1872. The water was off; it would be turned on later, for the party.

Dr. Thomas Blackwood was waiting for her in the rose garden. He was fifty-two years old, with silver hair and kind grey eyes. He had been the family's physician for twenty years.

'Good morning, Miss Ashworth.' He rose from the stone bench.

'Dr Blackwood.' She sat beside him. 'You said you had news.'

'I do.' He paused. 'It concerns your brother William.'

Eleanor's heart quickened. William had left England five years ago, after the scandal. He had gone to America, then Argentina, then—according to his last letter—to the Phillipines.

'Is he alive?'

'He is alive. He is healthy.' Thomas hesitated. 'But he has changed, Eleanor. The years abroad, the isolation—they have taken their toll.'

## CHAPTER THREE

The party began at seven o'clock precisely.

Two hundred guests filled the great hall: the local gentry, a few London acquaintances, and one very unexpected visitor.

'Miss Ashworth?' A man approached her—tall, dark haired, with an accent she couldn't place. 'My name is Edward Grey. I believe you knew my father.'

'Your father?' Eleanor searched her memory.

'Sir Arthur Grey. He was a friend of your grandfather's, many years ago.'

The name meant nothing. But something about Edward Grey's face—the set of his jaw, the intensity of his gaze—seemed familiar.

'I'm afraid I don't—'

'He died in 1898,' Edward continued. 'In Ceylon. He spoke of Whitmore House often. He said it was the most beautiful place he had ever seen.'

Eleanor looked around the great hall—at the chandeleirs her grandmother had installed, at the portraits of ancestors she had never known, at the french windows thrown open to the summer evening.

'It is beautiful,' she agreed. 'But beauty can hide many things.'

## CHAPTER FOUR

The letter arrived the next morning.

Eleanor found it on the breakfast table, addressed in handwriting she didn't recognise. The postmark said 'Manila'—William's last known address.

She opened it carefully.

*Dear Eleanor,*

*I am writing to warn you. Something is coming to Whitmore House—something that has been coming for a long time. You must be prepared.*

*Do not trust the grey-eyed man. Do not trust the doctor. Do not trust anyone who claims to know our family's history.*

*I cannot say more. They are watching.*

*Your brother,*
*William*

Eleanor read the letter twice. Then she folded it and placed it in her pocket.

The grey-eyed man. Dr. Blackwood's eyes were grey. So were Edward Grey's.

Which one was William warning her about? Or was it both?

## CHAPTER FIVE

That afternoon, Eleanor went to the library.

Whitmore House's library contained three thousand books—theology, history, natural philosophy, and fiction. But Eleanor wasn't looking for books. She was looking for something her grandfather had hidden there, decades ago.

She found it behind a false panel in the bookcase: a leather-bound journal, dated 1867.

*15 June 1867. The child was born today. A boy, healthy, with grey eyes like his father. Margaret does not know the truth. I pray she never learns.*

*20 June 1867. The boy has been sent away, to be raised in Ceylon by Sir Arthur Grey and his wife. He will inherit nothing. This secret must die with me.*

Eleanor's hands trembled. A child. A boy with grey eyes. Sent to Ceylon in 1867.

Edward Grey had said his father died in Ceylon in 1898.

She kept reading.

*3 December 1898. Word has reached me that Arthur Grey is dead. The boy—now a man of 31—has been told nothing. He does not know who he is.*

*But someday he will learn. And when he does, he will come to claim what is rightfully his.*

The journal ended there. The last entry was dated twenty-five years ago—the year of her grandfather's death.

## CHAPTER SIX

'You're looking for something.'

Eleanor spun around. Edward Grey stood in the library doorway, watching her.

'I was reading.' She closed the journal behind her back. 'That's what libraries are for.'

'And what were you reading?' He stepped closer. 'Something about our families, perhaps?'

'Our families have nothing to do with each other.'

'Don't they?' Edward's grey eyes met hers. 'My father told me stories, Miss Ashworth. Stories about this house, and the secrets it holds.'

'Your father was mistaken.'

'My father was many things. But he was never mistaken.' Edward paused. 'He told me that I would come here someday. That I would find what was taken from him. That I would set things right.'

Eleanor felt the journal pressing against her spine. 'I don't know what you're talking about.'

'Then you haven't read the journal yet.' He smiled. 'When you do—and you will—you'll understand everything.'

He turned and walked away. Eleanor waited until his footsteps faded, then opened the journal again.
