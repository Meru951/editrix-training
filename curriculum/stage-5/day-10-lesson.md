# Day 10: Professional Standards
## Stage 5: Speed & Final Assessment

---

This is your final day. By the end of it, you'll have proved you can proof fiction manuscripts confidently and accurately — or you'll know exactly what you need to work on.

---

## What "Done" Looks Like

A completed proof has:

### 1. A Marked Manuscript

Every error is marked clearly:
- Corrections are unambiguous
- Queries are polite and specific
- Nothing is marked that isn't an error

### 2. A Complete Style Sheet

Every decision is recorded:
- Character names and relationships
- Place names
- Terms and spelling choices
- Notes and queries for handover

### 3. Professional Presentation

- Annotations are legible
- Marks follow convention
- The package is ready for the next person

---

## The Self-Check

Before you submit any proof, ask:

**Accuracy:**
- Did I read every word, or did I skim anywhere?
- Did I check my style sheet against the manuscript?
- Did I catch myself drifting and stop?

**Consistency:**
- Is my style sheet complete?
- Did I check names and terms against my records?
- Are my decisions applied uniformly?

**Professionalism:**
- Are my marks clear?
- Are my queries polite and useful?
- Would I be happy to hand this to an editor?

## Ongoing Development

Passing this course makes you competent. It doesn't make you finished.

### Keep Learning

- Read New Hart's Rules cover to cover (if you haven't)
- Study problematic areas (hyphens, dialogue, whatever trips you up)
- Follow publishing style discussions (they evolve)

### Keep Practising

- Every proof you do makes you faster and more accurate
- Track your own errors — patterns will emerge
- Ask for feedback from editors

### Know When to Query

Competence includes knowing your limits. The best proofreaders ask questions when uncertain, not less.

## Today's Practice

One final exercise before the assessment:

- **Exercise 5.3:** Full simulation (15 pages, 40 minutes)

This mirrors the final assessment conditions.

---

## Final Assessment

**Format:** 15-page proof, realistic fiction passage.

**Errors seeded:** 40

**Requirements:**
- Catch at least 39 of 40 errors (98%)
- No more than 3 false positives
- Complete within 45 minutes
- Submit a usable style sheet

**If you pass:**
- Certificate of completion
- You are competent to proof fiction manuscripts with supervision
- You can proceed to live work

**If you don't pass:**
- You may retake once with a different passage
- Second fail → return to Stage 4 for remediation
- There's no shame in this. Mastery takes time.

## What You've Learned

Over the past ten days, you've built:

1. **Error detection:** Spotting typos, spelling errors, homophones
2. **Punctuation mastery:** Commas, dialogue, dashes, apostrophes
3. **Consistency tracking:** Names, places, terms, style sheets
4. **Integration skills:** Using all techniques together
5. **Speed and judgment:** Working efficiently, making good calls

You came in as a beginner. You leave as someone who can do this work.

---

## A Final Word

Proofreading is invisible work. When you do it well, nobody notices. The reader experiences a clean text and thinks nothing of it.

But you'll know. You caught the error on page 147. You fixed the inconsistency that would have slipped through. You held the standard.

That matters.

Good luck with your assessment. I'll be here if you have questions.
