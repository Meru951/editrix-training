# Day 9: Speed Without Sacrifice
## Stage 5: Speed & Final Assessment

---

You can proof accurately. Now you need to proof accurately and fast.

Commercial proofreading has deadlines. A proofreader who takes twice as long costs twice as much. Speed matters — but not at the expense of quality.

---

## Finding Your Threshold

Everyone has a speed/accuracy threshold. Push past it, and errors slip through.

Your job over the next two days:
1. Find your current threshold
2. Push it slightly, then stabilise
3. Build speed gradually without losing accuracy

## Speed Techniques

### 1. Reduce Re-Reading

The biggest time-waster is reading passages multiple times. Causes:

- Lost focus (you read but didn't process)
- Uncertainty (did I check that properly?)
- Poor technique (reading for meaning, not error)

**Fix:** Slow down slightly, but read only once. Counter-intuitive, but it works.

### 2. Develop Pattern Recognition

Experienced proofreaders don't read every letter. They recognise error patterns instantly:

- The shape of "teh" triggers alarm before conscious reading
- Dialogue punctuation errors pop out
- Inconsistent capitalisation catches the eye

This comes with practice. You're building it now.

### 3. Reduce Decision Time

Slow proofreaders spend time on every mark, wondering:
- Is this really wrong?
- Should I query?
- How do I phrase this?

**Fix:** Decide faster.
- If it's wrong, mark it. Move on.
- If it's uncertain, query briefly. Move on.
- Don't perfect your annotations.

### 4. Streamline Your Tools

Physical proofing:
- Have your style sheet visible, not buried
- Use consistent marks (don't reinvent them each time)
- Keep your reference materials at hand

Digital proofing:
- Learn keyboard shortcuts
- Set up quick-access comments
- Split-screen: manuscript and style sheet

## Where to Slow Down

Speed doesn't mean uniform speed. Some things deserve more time:

### Dialogue

Speech tags vs action beats. Nested quotes. Interrupted speech. These are error-dense zones.

### Names and Numbers

Katherine or Catherine? 1984 or 1894? These matter. Slow down.

### Chapter Openings

New chapters often introduce new settings, characters, terms. Update your style sheet.

### Anything You Almost Missed

If something catches your eye then you dismiss it — stop. Look again. That hesitation usually means something.

## Timed Practice

Today and tomorrow, you'll do timed drills:

| Drill | Pages | Target Time |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 5.1 | 5 | 12 minutes |
| 5.2 | 5 | 10 minutes |
| 5.3 | 15 | 40 minutes |

Each drill tracks:
- Time taken
- Errors caught
- False positives

The goal: maintain 98% accuracy as time pressure increases.

---

## What Professionals Achieve

For reference, experienced proofreaders typically proof:

- 10–15 pages per hour (fiction)
- With 95–99% accuracy
- While maintaining a style sheet

You're aiming for the lower end of that speed, with the higher end of accuracy.

## Today's Practice

Log in to the training portal:

- **Exercise 5.1:** Speed drill (5 pages, 12 minutes)
- **Exercise 5.2:** Speed drill (5 pages, 10 minutes)

Track your results. Where do you lose accuracy?

## Key Takeaways

1. Speed comes from efficiency, not rushing.
2. Read once, properly. Don't re-read.
3. Decide quickly. Mark and move on.
4. Slow down for dialogue, names, numbers.
5. Find your threshold. Push it gradually.
