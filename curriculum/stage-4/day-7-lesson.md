# Day 7: Putting It Together
## Stage 4: Integration

---

You've learned the individual skills. Now you use them all at once, on real manuscript pages, under real conditions.

---

## The Integration Challenge

Spotting typos is easy when that's all you're doing. Spotting typos while also checking punctuation, watching for consistency, and maintaining your style sheet is hard.

Your brain has limited attention. Split it across multiple tasks, and each task suffers.

The solution isn't to try harder. It's to develop systems.

---

## Systematic Approaches

### Option 1: Multiple Passes

Some proofreaders read the manuscript several times, focusing on different things:

- **Pass 1:** Spelling and typos
- **Pass 2:** Punctuation and dialogue
- **Pass 3:** Consistency and style sheet

**Advantage:** High accuracy. Each pass is focused.  
**Disadvantage:** Takes longer. May not be commercially viable.

### Option 2: Single Pass, Layered Attention

Most professional proofreaders do one pass, with layered attention:

- **Primary focus:** The text in front of you (errors, punctuation)
- **Background awareness:** Does this match what I've seen before? (consistency)
- **Recording:** Update style sheet without breaking flow

This is faster but requires practice.

### Option 3: Hybrid

- **Main pass:** Everything together
- **Targeted checks:** Quick second passes for known problem areas (names, dates, hyphenation)

Find what works for you. There's no single right method.

## Managing Cognitive Load

### Chunk Your Work

Don't try to proof for four hours straight. Your accuracy will collapse.

- Work in 45–60 minute blocks
- Take genuine breaks (not just phone-scrolling)
- Return fresh

### Know Your Weak Spots

Everyone misses certain things more than others. Common patterns:

- Dialogue punctuation errors (especially speech tag vs action beat)
- Hyphenation inconsistencies
- Homophones
- Numbers and dates

Track your errors. Target your weak areas.

### Environmental Factors

- **Quiet matters.** Distractions kill accuracy.
- **Screen vs paper.** Some proofreaders catch more on paper. Know yourself.
- **Font size.** Bigger is easier. Don't strain.

---

## Stamina and Focus

A novel is 80,000+ words. You can't maintain peak focus for all of it.

**Strategies:**

- Start sessions with difficult passages (your attention is freshest)
- Save mechanical checks (running heads, folios) for when you're tired
- If you catch yourself skimming, stop. Take a break.

---

## The Discipline of Not Rewriting

You will see sentences that could be better. Constructions that are clumsy. Word choices that aren't quite right.

**Leave them alone.**

You are a proofreader. Your job is to catch errors, not to improve prose. The author chose those words. The editor approved them. It's not your call.

Mark only:
- Clear errors
- Inconsistencies
- Queries where something seems wrong

Do not mark:
- Stylistic preferences
- "I would have written it differently"
- Anything that isn't actually wrong

---

## Folio and Running Head Checks

These are quick checks that catch errors others miss.

**Folio (page numbers):**
- Should run sequentially — watch for jumps or repeats
- Front matter often uses roman numerals (i, ii, iii) while main text uses arabic (1, 2, 3)
- Check that the sequence doesn't break unexpectedly

**Running heads (headers at top of pages):**
- Should match chapter or section titles
- Watch for errors after section breaks — the header might not update
- Left and right pages may show different information (author/title, chapter/section)

A quick scan of page numbers and headers at the end of your proof catches errors that slip through when you're focused on text.

---

## Orphans and Widows (Awareness)

These are traditionally the typesetter's concern, not the proofreader's — but it's good to know what they are.

- **Orphan:** First line of a paragraph alone at the bottom of a page
- **Widow:** Last line of a paragraph alone at the top of a page

Some houses also define these differently, so check your style guide.

You're not expected to fix these (that's a layout decision), but you may note them as a courtesy query if they're particularly awkward.

## Today's Practice

Log in to the training portal:

- **Exercise 4.1:** Full chapter proof, all error types (10 pages)
- **Exercise 4.2:** Query practice (5 ambiguous cases, write queries)

Take your time. This is where it comes together.

## Key Takeaways

1. Integration is hard. Develop systems.
2. Multiple passes, single pass, or hybrid — find your method.
3. Work in focused blocks. Fatigue kills accuracy.
4. Know your weak spots. Target them.
5. Don't rewrite. Catch errors, nothing more.
