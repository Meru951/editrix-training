      "Elisabeth found the photograph while cleaning out her grandmother's attic. It was tucked inside an old copy of Jane Eyre, yellowed with age and curling at the edges. The image showed two women standing arm in arm outside a building she didn't recognise.",
      "",
      "One of the women was clearly her grandmother—younger, perhaps thirty, with the same sharp cheekbones and dark hair that Elizabeth had inherited. The other woman was a stranger: blonde, smiling, wearing a nurse's uniform.",
      "",
      "'Mum?' Elisabeth called down the stairs. 'Can you come up here for a minute?'",
      "",
      "Her mother appeared in the attic doorway, dusty and tired. They had been sorting through grandmother's possessions for three days now, ever since the funeral last week. 'What is it'?",
      "",
      "'Who is this?' Elizabeth held up the photograph.",
      "",
      "Her mother took it, squinting in the dim light. 'I don't—' She stopped. Her face changed. 'Where did you find this?'",
      "",
      "'In a book. Jane Eyre. It was on the shelf over there.' Elisabeth pointed. 'Mum, whats wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.'",
      "",
      "Her mother sat down on an old trunk, still holding the photograph. 'This is Rose,' she said finally. 'Rose Hartley. I haven't seen her face in fourty years.'",
      "",
      "'Who was she?'",
      "",
      "'Your grandmother's... friend.' The pause was deliberate. 'They met during the war. They were both nurses at St Thomas's Hospital in London. Nineteen fourty-two, I think, or maybe 'forty-three.'",
      "",
      "Elizabeth sat down beside her mother. 'You never mentioned her before.'",
      "",
      "'Your grandmother didn't like to talk about her. They were very close—for years. And then something happened, and Rose left, and grandmother never spoke of her again.' She turned the photograph over. On the back, in faded pencil: Margaret and Rose, VE Day, nineteen fourty-five.",
      "",
      "'VE Day,' Elizabeth said. 'Victory in Europe. That was May 1945, right?'",
      "",
      "'May 8th.' Her mother's voice was distant. 'The war in Europe ended. Everyone was celebrating. And somewhere in all that joy, something went wrong between them.'",
      "",
      "Elisabeth took the photograph back, studying the two womens faces. Her grandmother was laughing, head thrown back, carefree in a way Elizabeth had never seen. Rose was looking at her with an expression that seemed almost—",
      "",
      "'Mum,' she said slowly, 'were they... more than friends?'",
      "",
      "Her mother was quiet for a long moment. 'I wondered that myself, for years. Grandmother would never say. But the way she kept this photograph—hidden, secret—' She sighed. 'I think she loved Rose. I think Rose loved her too. But it was a different time. They couldn't...'",
      "",
      "'They couldn't be together.' Elizabeth finished the sentence. 'God, how sad.'",
      "",
      "'It was. I think grandmother carried that sadness her whole life.' Her mother stood, brushing dust from her trousers. 'I tried to find Rose once, you know. After your grandfather died, when grandmother was finally alone. I thought maybe they could reconnect.'",
      "",
      "'What happened.'",
      "",
      "'Rose had died. Cancer, in nineteen seventy-eight. She never married. Neither did grandmother, really—not in any way that mattered. Your grandfather was a good man, but he wasn't...'",
      "",
      "'He wasn't Rose.'",
      "",
      "'No.' Her mother picked up the copy of Jane Eyre, turning it over in her hands. 'She kept this book on her nightstand until the day she died. I always wondered why it was so important to her. Now I know.'",
      "",
      "Elisabeth opened the book and flipped through the pages. There, between chapters fifteen and sixteen, was another photograph—smaller, more intimate. Rose alone, laughing at the camera, a cigarette in her hand. On the back: my darling R, Christmas nineteen fourty-four.",
      "",
      "'My darling,' Elisabeth whispered. 'She called her \"my darling.\"'",
      "",
      "Her mother nodded, tears in her eyes. 'All those years. Sixty years of silence. Sixty years of hiding that photograph in a book.' She took a shaky breath. 'I wish she could have told us. I wish she hadn't had to hide.'",
      "",
      "Elizabeth put her arm around her mother. 'Times are different now. She'd be happy to know that.'",
      "",
      "'Would she?' Her mother's voice was bitter. 'Or would she be angry that it took so long? All those lives, lived in secret. All that love, never spoken.'",
      "",
      "They sat together in the dusty attic, the photograph between them. Outside, the light was fading—late afternoon sliding into evening. Somewhere downstairs, a clock chimed five.",
      "",
      "'What should we do with them?' Elisabeth asked. 'The photographs?'",
      "",
      "'Keep them,' her mother said firmly. 'Frame them, if you want. Let grandmother and Rose be seen, finally. Let people know they existed, that they loved each other.'",
      "",
      "Elizabeth nodded. 'I will.'",
      "",
      "She looked down at the photograph in her hands—two young women, arm in arm, on the happiest day of the war. They had no idea what was coming. No idea that they would be separated, that they would spend the rest of they're lives apart, carrying a secret that they could never share.",
      "",
      "But they had had this moment. This one perfect day, captured forever in black and white.",
      "",
      "'I hope you found each other again,' Elizabeth whispered. 'Wherever you are now.'",
      "",
      "Her mother squeezed her hand. 'I like to think they did.'",
      "",
      "They finished sorting through the attic as the light faded outside. Elizabeth took the photographs home with her that evening, along with the copy of Jane Eyre. She would frame them tommorow, she decided. Put them somewhere prominent, where visitors could see.",
      "",
      "Let grandmother have, finally, what she had been denied in life: the freedom to love openly, without shame.",
      "",
      "It was the least Elisabeth could do."
