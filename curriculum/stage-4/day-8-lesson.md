# Day 8: Queries and Judgment
## Stage 4: Integration

---

Not everything is black and white. Some things look wrong but might be intentional. Some things are definitely wrong but you're not sure of the fix.

This is where judgment matters.

---

## When to Fix Silently

Fix without querying when:

- **It's clearly a typo.** "Teh" → "the". No question.
- **It contradicts established style.** "Katherine" appears 50 times, "Katharine" once. Fix the outlier.
- **It's a mechanical error.** Missing full stop. Unclosed quotation mark. Obvious.
- **House style is clear.** The style guide says single quotation marks. You see double. Fix it.

---

## When to Query

Query when:

- **You're not sure which is correct.** Two different dates given for the same event.
- **It might be intentional.** The author uses "alright" throughout. Is this a choice or a mistake?
- **Fixing it would change meaning.** A word that seems wrong but might be dialect.
- **It's beyond your scope.** A factual claim that seems dubious.
- **Multiple valid options exist.** Both "grey" and "gray" appear. Which does the author prefer?

## How to Write a Query

A query is a question, not a correction. Tone matters.

### Good Query Structure

1. **Locate:** Where is the issue?
2. **Describe:** What have you noticed?
3. **Ask:** What would you like clarified?

### Examples

**Good:**
> p. 47: "Margaret was thirty-five" — but on p. 23 she was thirty-two and three years have not passed in the narrative. Please check.

**Also good:**
> p. 112: "She lead the group" — should this be "led"?

**Also good:**
> p. 89: "grey" used here, but "gray" on p. 14. Please confirm preferred spelling for consistency.

### Bad Queries

> p. 47: WRONG. Fix this.

(Rude. Unhelpful. What's wrong?)

> p. 112: This should obviously be "led" but I've put a query anyway.

(If it's obvious, just fix it.)

> I think this would read better as...

(Not your job.)

## Query Placement

**On a physical proof:** Write queries in the margin, clearly marked (e.g., "Q:" or circled).

**On a PDF:** Use comment boxes. Be concise.

**On a style sheet:** Include a "Queries" section for issues needing resolution.

## Judgment Calls

### Dialect and Non-Standard English

Characters might speak "incorrectly" — that's voice.

- "I ain't going nowhere" — don't correct to "I'm not going anywhere"
- "She were right tired" — regional dialect, not an error

**Query if:** You're unsure whether it's intentional.  
**Don't touch if:** It's clearly a character's voice.

### Intentional Rule-Breaking

Authors break rules for effect:

- Sentence fragments. For emphasis.
- Paragraphs that are one word. 

Don't "fix" style.

### Historical or Period Settings

Older settings may use older conventions:

- "'Twas a fine morning" — archaic, not wrong
- "She was got with child" — period usage

**If it feels wrong, query. Don't assume.**

## The Escalation Ladder

Some issues you can handle. Some you can't.

1. **Clear error:** Fix it.
2. **Unclear but within scope:** Query the author/editor.
3. **Beyond your expertise:** Flag for the editor with a note.
4. **Legal/ethical concern:** Escalate immediately.

You're not expected to know everything. You're expected to know your limits.

---

## Today's Practice

Log in to the training portal:

- **Exercise 4.3:** Timed chapter proof (10 pages, 30 minutes)

This prepares you for the Stage 4 test.

---

## Stage 4 Test: Tomorrow

You'll receive a 10-page chapter with 30 mixed errors.

**To pass:** 
- Catch at least 29 of 30 errors (95%)
- No more than 3 false positives
- Complete within 35 minutes

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Fix obvious errors silently.
2. Query when uncertain or when it might be intentional.
3. Queries are polite questions, not corrections.
4. Don't touch dialect or intentional style.
5. Know your limits. Escalate when necessary.
