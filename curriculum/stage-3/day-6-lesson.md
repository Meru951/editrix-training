# Day 6: The Working Style Sheet
## Stage 3: Consistency & Style Sheets

---

Yesterday you learned what to track. Today you learn how to track it efficiently and hand it over usefully.

---

## Style Sheet Organisation

A chaotic style sheet is useless. Organise it so you can find things instantly.

### Recommended Sections

**A. Characters**
Alphabetical by first name or surname (pick one, stick to it).

**B. Places**
Real places first, then fictional.

**C. Terms & Spelling**
Alphabetical. This will be your longest section.

**D. Numbers & Dates**
Style decisions for times, dates, currencies.

**E. Dialogue & Punctuation**
Any house-style decisions (ellipses, dashes, contractions).

**F. Notes & Queries**
Anything you're unsure about. Flags for the editor.

## Working with the Style Sheet

### Proofing Workflow

1. **Proof a section** (page, scene, chapter)
2. **Update your style sheet** as you encounter new names/terms
3. **Check back** when you see something familiar
4. **Mark inconsistencies** against your recorded standard

### Speed vs Thoroughness

Early in the manuscript, you'll add to the sheet frequently. Later, you'll mostly check against it. This is normal.

**Don't skip updating.** The character introduced on page 180 matters as much as the one on page 1.

## What Good Looks Like

### A Good Style Sheet Entry

**Character:**
> **Margaret Thorne** — protagonist, widow, late 50s, grey hair. Lives at Thornwood Manor. Brother: Charles (abroad). Neighbour: Dr Patterson.

This tells the next reader:
- Exact spelling
- Key facts for continuity checking
- Relationships

### A Bad Style Sheet Entry

> Margaret — main character

This tells nothing useful.

## The Handover

Your style sheet isn't just for you. It goes to:
- The editor (for reference)
- The next proofreader (if there is one)
- The production team (for queries)

### What to Include in Handover

1. **All style decisions made** — not just uncertainties
2. **Queries clearly marked** — what needs author/editor input
3. **Reasoning where helpful** — "Used 'grey' throughout as per first instance p.3"

### What to Avoid

- **Incomplete entries** — if you recorded it, include it
- **Unexplained queries** — say why you're querying
- **Personal shorthand** — use clear language

---

## Consistency Checking Techniques

### The Final Pass

After proofing, do a consistency pass:

1. Read through your style sheet
2. For each entry, search the manuscript (if digital)
3. Confirm all instances match

This catches what you missed in linear reading.

### Cross-Referencing

When you find an inconsistency, don't just mark it. Check:

- Which version appears more often?
- Which appears first?
- Is there a reason for variation? (Maybe one is in dialogue, reflecting how a character speaks.)

## Today's Practice

Log in to the training portal:

- **Exercise 3.3:** Timeline check (spot chronological errors)
- **Exercise 3.4:** Character consistency (spot description contradictions)

Tomorrow: Stage 3 test — consistency assessment with style sheet creation.

---

## Stage 3 Test: Tomorrow

You'll receive a 5-page passage with 15 consistency errors. You must:

1. Catch at least 14 of 15 errors
2. Submit a usable style sheet

**Time limit:** 25 minutes.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Organise your style sheet: characters, places, terms, numbers.
2. Update as you go. Don't wait until the end.
3. Good entries include spelling, key facts, relationships.
4. The style sheet is a handover document. Make it useful for others.
5. Do a final consistency pass using your sheet.
