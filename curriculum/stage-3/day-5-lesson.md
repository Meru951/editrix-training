# Day 5: Tracking Consistency
## Stage 3: Consistency & Style Sheets

---

You can spot typos and fix punctuation. Now for the skill that separates competent proofreaders from good ones: consistency.

A reader may not notice a single inconsistency. But inconsistencies accumulate. They create a feeling that something is wrong, that nobody cared enough to check. Your job is to care.

## What to Track

### Character Names

Fiction is full of names, and authors make mistakes.

- Is it Katherine or Catherine?
- Grey or Gray?
- O'Brien or O'Brian?

**First instance wins.** When you first encounter a name, record it. Every subsequent appearance must match.

Watch for:
- Spelling variants (Steven/Stephen, Ann/Anne)
- Nicknames (is Elizabeth called Beth, Lizzie, or Liz?)
- Titles (is it Dr Patterson or Dr. Patterson? Mrs or Mrs.?)

### Place Names

Same principle. First instance sets the standard.

- Is it Thornwood Manor or Thornwood manor?
- The High Street or the high street?
- Grey Stone cottage or Greystone Cottage?

**Capitalisation matters.** Be consistent.

For real places, check the correct spelling. Is it Edinborough or Edinburgh? (It's Edinburgh.)

### Terms and Objects

Any repeated term should be consistent:

- Drawing-room, drawing room, or drawingroom?
- Spell book, spellbook, or spell-book?
- Okay, OK, or ok?

Record your first encounter. Enforce it throughout.

### Timeline and Continuity

Fiction has internal logic. Catch contradictions:

- "It was Tuesday" but three days later is "Friday" (should be Friday)
- A character is 35 in chapter 2 but 37 in chapter 5 (two years didn't pass)
- Blue eyes in chapter 1, green eyes in chapter 8

Some of these you'll catch. Some you'll miss. But stay alert.

## The Style Sheet

A style sheet is your working document. It records every decision you make.

### Why Keep One?

1. **Memory:** You can't remember everything. Write it down.
2. **Consistency:** Checking against your record is faster than searching the manuscript.
3. **Handover:** The next person who works on this manuscript will thank you.

### What to Record

**Characters:**
- Name and spelling
- Key relationships (whose sister? whose employer?)
- Physical details mentioned (hair colour, age)

**Places:**
- Name and spelling
- Capitalisation (the Manor or the manor?)

**Terms:**
- Hyphenation decisions (drawing-room)
- Spelling choices (grey not gray)
- Capitalisation (the War or the war?)

**Numbers:**
- Spelled out or figures? (twenty or 20?)
- Times (8 a.m. or 8am or eight o'clock?)
- Dates (1 January or January 1 or 1st January?)

## Building the Style Sheet

Start from page one. As you proof:

1. **First encounter:** Record the spelling/style in your sheet.
2. **Subsequent encounters:** Check against your sheet. If it matches, move on. If not, mark the error.
3. **Uncertain?** Query. Don't guess.

### Example Entry

**Characters:**
- Margaret (never Margret) — protagonist, widow, late 50s
- Dr Thomas Patterson (not Paterson) — neighbour, retired
- Charles — Margaret's brother, traveller

**Places:**
- Thornwood Manor (capital M)
- the village (lowercase)
- the High Street (capital H, capital S)

**Terms:**
- grey (not gray)
- travelling, travelled (double l)
- drawing-room (hyphenated)

## Spotting Variants

Your eye will slide past inconsistencies if you're reading for meaning. Strategies:

### Search Function

If proofing digitally, search for a name when you first encounter it. Do all instances match?

### Suspicion Mode

When you see a name, pause. Ask: is this exactly how I've seen it before? If uncertain, check your sheet.

### Patterns

Common inconsistency patterns:
- Doubled vs single letters (travelling/traveling)
- Hyphens appearing and disappearing (drawing-room/drawing room)
- Capitals drifting (the Manor/the manor)
- Nicknames changing (Beth/Liz for same character)

## Today's Practice

Log in to the training portal:

- **Exercise 3.1:** Find the inconsistencies (passage with 10 variant spellings)
- **Exercise 3.2:** Build a style sheet (proof 3 pages, create style sheet simultaneously)

## Key Takeaways

1. First instance sets the standard. Record it.
2. Keep a style sheet. Your memory will fail.
3. Track: names, places, terms, timeline.
4. When variants appear, mark the inconsistency.
5. When uncertain, query. Don't guess.
