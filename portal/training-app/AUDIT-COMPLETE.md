# Trainer Audit Complete ✅

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Inaccurate Hint
- **Before:** "Look for a doubled word in the early paragraphs"
- **Problem:** The error was actually an INSERTED word ("no the answer"), not doubled
- **Fixed:** "Look for an extra word that shouldn't be there"

### 2. Missing Answer Key
- **Before:** No proper answer key for grading
- **Fixed:** Added complete answer key with 11 verified errors

### 3. Incorrect Error Count
- **Before:** Said "75 errors" but sample only has 11
- **Fixed:** Shows "11 errors" with note "(Full manuscript has 75)"

### 4. Improved Grading
- **Before:** Just counted marks
- **Fixed:** Actually compares marks to answer key, shows what was found/missed

## Teaching Accuracy Check

Each error teaches a real proofreading skill:

1. **Spelling errors (6):** Common misspellings students will encounter
2. **Consistency (1):** Name spelling must be consistent throughout
3. **Inserted word (1):** Sometimes extra words slip in
4. **Missing word (1):** Articles can be accidentally deleted
5. **Punctuation (2):** Question marks vs periods, comma placement

**All errors are genuine proofreading issues that would appear in real manuscripts.**
