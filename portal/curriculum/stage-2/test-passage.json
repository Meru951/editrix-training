      "Margaret had been waiting for nearly an hour when Thomas finally arrived. He looked tired, she thought, older than when she had last seen him.  The years had not been kind.",
      "",
      "\"I wasn't sure you'd come.\" she said.",
      "",
      "'I almost didn't.' He sat down across from her, avoiding her eyes. 'After everything that happened—I didn't know if I could face you.'",
      "",
      "'I understand.' She reached across the table but he pulled his hand away. 'Thomas, please. Its been ten years.'",
      "",
      "'Ten years' he repeated. 'Is that supposed to make it better'?",
      "",
      "The café was quiet at this hour; just the two of them and an elderly, grey haired man reading a newspaper in the corner. Margaret had chosen this place carefully. Somewhere public. Somewhere safe. She had packed three things in her bag; her phone, her notebook and the letter.",
      "",
      "'I found something.' she said. 'Something you need to see.'",
      "",
      "He looked up. 'What do you mean?'",
      "",
      "'Mother's papers. I was going through them after—well, afterwards—and I found a letter. Its addressed to you.'",
      "",
      "Thomas's face changed. 'A letter? From mother?'",
      "",
      "'She wrote it before she died. I think—' Margaret paused, unsure how to continue. 'I think it explains everything. Why she made the choices she made. Why she left the house to me and not to you—'",
      "",
      "'Stop.' He held up his hand. 'I dont want to hear this. Not now. Not after all these years.'",
      "",
      "'But Thomas—'",
      "",
      "'I said stop'! He stood up, his chair scraping loudly against the floor. The elderly man glanced up from his newspaper. 'You dont get to do this. You dont get to wait ten years and then—'",
      "",
      "'I didnt have the letter ten years ago!' Margaret's voice rose. 'I only found it last month. I came as soon as I could.'",
      "",
      "Thomas stood there, his hands trembling. Margaret could see the conflict in his face—the anger, the grief, the desperate need to know. She had seen that look before, on the day of the funeral which had torn them apart. The day he had walked out and never come back.",
      "",
      "'The letter explains why she did it.' Margaret spoke quietly now. 'She loved you Thomas. More than you ever knew. But there were things—things she couldn't tell you. Things about father.'",
      "",
      "He sat down slowly. 'What things'?",
      "",
      "'Things that change everything. Things that mean—' she took a breath '—that none of this was ever about you. It was about protecting you. From the truth.'"
