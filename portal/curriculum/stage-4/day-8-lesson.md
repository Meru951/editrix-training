# Day 8: Numbers, Dates, and Times

---

Nothing says "amateur" like inconsistent number treatment. Is it "twenty-three" or "23"? Is it "1 January" or "January 1st"?

The answer depends on house style — but whatever the style, consistency is mandatory.

## The Basic Rule: Spell Out or Use Figures?

Different publishers have different rules. The most common approaches:

### Approach 1: Spell Out 1–10, Figures for 11+

> She had three cats and 15 dogs.

### Approach 2: Spell Out 1–100, Figures for 101+

> She had twenty-three cats and 156 dogs.

### Approach 3: Spell Out Numbers That Can Be Written in One or Two Words

> She had twenty-three cats and 156 dogs.

**New Hart's Rules** (British standard) recommends spelling out numbers up to one hundred in non-technical contexts, especially in fiction.

## When to ALWAYS Spell Out

### 1. At the Start of a Sentence

❌ 23 cats sat on the fence.
✓ Twenty-three cats sat on the fence.

If the number is very long, rewrite the sentence:

❌ 1,247 people attended the event.
❌ One thousand two hundred and forty-seven people attended the event.
✓ The event attracted 1,247 people.

### 2. Round Numbers

> about a hundred people
> thousands of years
> millions of pounds

### 3. In Dialogue (Usually)

Characters don't usually speak in figures:

> 'I've lived here for twenty years.'

Not:

> 'I've lived here for 20 years.'

---

## When to ALWAYS Use Figures

### 1. Technical or Statistical Contexts

> The temperature reached 37°C.
> The study included 847 participants.

### 2. With Units of Measurement

> 5 km
> 10 kg
> 250 ml

### 3. Page Numbers, Chapters, Etc.

> page 23
> chapter 5
> Act 2, Scene 3

### 4. Percentages

> 15 per cent (or 15%) — be consistent about "per cent" vs "%"

### 5. Money (Usually)

> £5.50
> $100

But in dialogue or narrative: "five pounds," "a hundred dollars"

## Dates

### British Format

> 1 January 2026
> 15 March 1990

**Not:**
> January 1, 2026 ← American format
> 1st January 2026 ← ordinal unnecessary

### In Running Text

> They arrived on 1 January.
> The meeting is on 15 March.

### Decades

> the 1990s (no apostrophe)
> the nineties
> the '90s (apostrophe before, not after)

### Centuries

> the twenty-first century
> the 21st century

## Times

### British Style

Note:
- Full stop between hours and minutes (not colon)

- Space between number and a.m./p.m.

### Alternative Formats

Some publishers use:
> 8:30 am

> 0830

**Check the house style and be consistent.**

### 24-Hour Clock

## Common Errors

### 1. Inconsistent Treatment

✓ She had three cats and five dogs.

### 2. Starting a Sentence with Figures

❌ 50 years ago, the world was different.
✓ Fifty years ago, the world was different.

### 3. Wrong Date Format

❌ January 1st, 2026
✓ 1 January 2026

### 4. Apostrophe in Decades

❌ the 1990's
✓ the 1990s

### 5. Inconsistent Time Format

❌ at 3pm ... at 5.00 p.m.
✓ at 3.00 p.m. ... at 5.00 p.m.

## The Consistency Check

When proofreading, add number style to your style sheet:

```
NUMBERS
Spell out 1–100
Figures for 101+
Figures with measurements

DATES
1 January 2026 format
No ordinals (not 1st, 2nd)

TIMES
8.30 a.m. format
Full stop, not colon
Space before a.m./p.m.
```

## Today's Exercise

Correct the numbers, dates, and times in this passage:

> 23 people attended the meeting on January 15th, 2026. The event started at 2:30pm and lasted for 3 hours. 
>
> "I've been working here for 15 years," said Sarah, who had joined in the 1990's. She remembered when there were only five employees and a budget of £50000.
>
> The report showed that 85 percent of customers were satisfied, while only ten percent complained. The remaining 5% had no opinion.

---

## Answers

**Corrected:**

> Twenty-three people attended the meeting on 15 January 2026. The event started at 2.30 p.m. and lasted for three hours.
>
> 'I've been working here for fifteen years,' said Sarah, who had joined in the 1990s. She remembered when there were only five employees and a budget of £50,000.
>
> The report showed that 85 per cent of customers were satisfied, while only ten per cent complained. The remaining 5 per cent had no opinion.

**Corrections:**
1. 23 people → Twenty-three people (start of sentence)
2. January 15th, 2026 → 15 January 2026 (British format)
3. 2:30pm → 2.30 p.m. (British format)
4. 3 hours → three hours (spell out small numbers)
5. 15 years → fifteen years (spell out in dialogue)
6. 1990's → 1990s (no apostrophe)
7. £50000 → £50,000 (add comma)
8. 85 percent → 85 per cent (British: two words)
9. ten percent → ten per cent (consistency)
10. 5% → 5 per cent (consistency)
