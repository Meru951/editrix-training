# Day 7: Hyphenation and Compounds

---

A "man eating shark" is a man who eats shark. A "man-eating shark" is a shark that eats men.

Hyphens clarify meaning. Get them wrong, and you change what the sentence says.

## The Core Rule: Compound Adjectives Before Nouns

When two or more words work together to describe a noun, and they come **before** the noun, hyphenate them:

> a well-known author
> a high-quality product
> a full-time job
> a five-year-old child

**But not after the noun:**

> the author is well known
> the product is high quality
> the job is full time
> the child is five years old

Why? Before the noun, the hyphen prevents ambiguity. After the noun, the meaning is clear without it.

---

## Test: Does It Create Ambiguity?

Ask yourself: "Without the hyphen, could this be misread?"

> small-business owner → owns a small business
> small business owner → a business owner who is small?

> deep-sea fishing → fishing in deep sea
> deep sea fishing → could be misread

> man-eating shark → shark that eats men
> man eating shark → man who eats shark

If ambiguity is possible, hyphenate.

## Common Compound Adjectives

These almost always need hyphens before a noun:

| Compound | Example |
|----------|---------|
| well-known | a well-known author |
| long-term | a long-term investment |
| short-term | a short-term solution |
| high-quality | a high-quality product |
| low-cost | a low-cost option |
| full-time | a full-time job |
| part-time | a part-time worker |
| old-fashioned | an old-fashioned idea |
| up-to-date | up-to-date information |
| state-of-the-art | state-of-the-art technology |
| face-to-face | a face-to-face meeting |

## When NOT to Hyphenate

### 1. After the Noun

> The author is well known.
> The job is full time.

### 2. With -ly Adverbs

Adverbs ending in -ly don't need hyphens — the -ly signals that it modifies the next word:

❌ a beautifully-written book
✓ a beautifully written book

❌ a highly-skilled worker
✓ a highly skilled worker

**Exception:** If the -ly word is an adjective, not an adverb:

✓ a friendly-looking dog ("friendly" here is an adjective)
✓ a costly-looking mistake

### 3. Established Compounds

Some compounds are so common they've become single words:

> healthcare (not health-care)
> worldwide (not world-wide)
> online (not on-line)
> database (not data-base)

Check a dictionary if you're unsure.

---

## Suspended Hyphens

When two compounds share an element, use a suspended hyphen:

> full- and part-time workers
> long- and short-term goals
> two-, three-, and four-bedroom flats

Note the space after the suspended hyphen.

---

## Numbers and Hyphens

### Compound Numbers (21–99)

> twenty-one
> ninety-nine
> forty-five

### Fractions

> three-quarters
> two-thirds
> one-half

### Age Before Noun

> a five-year-old child

### Age After Noun or Standalone

> the child is five years old
> a child of five

---

## Prefixes

Most prefixes don't need hyphens in British English:

> rewrite, coexist, prewar, postmodern, antiwar

**Use a hyphen when:**

1. **Double vowel creates confusion:**
> co-operate (or cooperate — both acceptable)
> re-enter
> anti-inflammatory

2. **Prefix + proper noun:**
> pre-Victorian
> pro-European
> anti-American

3. **To avoid confusion with another word:**
> re-cover (cover again) vs recover (get better)
> re-sign (sign again) vs resign (quit)
> re-creation vs recreation

---

## Common Errors to Catch

### 1. Missing Hyphen Before Noun

❌ a well known author
✓ a well-known author

### 2. Unnecessary Hyphen After Noun

❌ The author is well-known.
✓ The author is well known.

### 3. Hyphen with -ly Adverb

❌ a highly-skilled worker
✓ a highly skilled worker

### 4. Inconsistent Treatment

❌ full-time job ... fulltime worker
✓ full-time job ... full-time worker
