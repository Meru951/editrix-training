## Behavioral Design

**Why 90%?**
- Sets a high bar — certificate means something
- Creates healthy challenge — "Can I do it?"
- Retakes allowed — failure isn't final, it's practice
- Earned, not given — pride of achievement

**Retake journey:**
- First attempt: baseline
- Review weak areas
- Retake with focus
- Hit 90% → celebrate
