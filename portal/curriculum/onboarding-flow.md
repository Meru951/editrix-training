## Stage 3: Welcome Email (Day 0)

**Subject:** Welcome to the Proofreading Programme — Read This First

**From:** Diana <diana@editrix.ai>

---

Hello [Name],

Welcome. I'm Diana, and I'll be your instructor for the next 10 days.

Before we begin, let me be clear about what this is.

**This is professional training, not a casual course.**

I'm preparing you for real editorial work — the kind where deadlines matter and mistakes cost money. How you handle this programme tells me how you'll handle real assignments.

### What I Expect From You

1. **Complete each day's work within 24 hours.** Life happens — if something comes up, tell me. Silence is not acceptable.

2. **Aim for accuracy.** Speed matters, but not at the expense of quality. Take the time to get it right.

3. **Finish what you start.** The certificate means you completed all 10 days at a professional standard. Partial completion earns nothing.

### How Grading Works

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Accuracy | 50% | Errors correctly identified |
| Speed | 30% | Completing exercises within target time |
| Commitment | 20% | Submitting work on schedule |

**On-time:** Full commitment marks  
**1 day late:** -10%  
**2 days late:** -20%  
**3+ days late:** -30% and a conversation about whether to continue

### What You Get If You Complete

- Certificate of completion
- Priority consideration for freelance work with Editrix
- A professional skill that pays

### Your Portal

[Access Your Dashboard →]

Day 1 begins tomorrow at 6:00 AM your time. Your first lesson will arrive by email, and exercises will be waiting in the portal.

Let's begin.

## Stage 4: Day 1 Kickoff

Good morning [Name],

Day 1 is live.

**Today's lesson:** What Proofreaders Actually Do  
**Estimated time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Deadline:** 24 hours from now

[Read Today's Lesson →]

When you've read the lesson, complete the exercises in the portal. The system tracks your time and accuracy.

A few first-day tips:
- Read the lesson fully before starting exercises
- Don't rush — accuracy matters more than speed today
- Use the chat if you're stuck (I'm here)

Tomorrow, we build on this. Don't fall behind on Day 1.

### What Happens Next

High performers (A grade, all submissions on time) are invited to join our freelance pool. You'll receive real manuscripts to proof, with pay.

I'll be in touch within 7 days if you qualify. If you don't hear from me, it means we don't have current openings — but keep your skills sharp. Opportunities come around.

Thank you for your commitment. It was noticed.

### Final Assessment Failed

**Subject:** Your Results — And What's Next

---

[Name],

You've completed the Proofreading Programme, but your final score didn't meet the passing threshold.

**Your Results:**
- Overall accuracy: [X]%
- Required to pass: 90%
- Submissions on time: [X]/10

### What This Means

You have two options:

1. **Retake the final assessment** (one attempt, within 7 days)
2. **Restart the programme** (from Day 1, fresh attempt)

Many people pass on their second try. The material is the same — you just need more practice.

Reply to this email to let me know which you'd prefer.

### Did Not Complete

You completed [X] of 10 days.

Take care,

Diana

## Tone Guidelines

### Kind but Firm
- Acknowledge their effort
- Be direct about expectations
- Never apologise for having standards
- Offer help, not excuses

### Examples

**Too soft:**
> "No worries if you're running late! Just do your best when you can 😊"

**Too harsh:**
> "You're late. This is unacceptable. Do better."

**Just right:**
> "Day 3 is now late. This affects your grade. Complete it today if you can — and if something's in the way, tell me."
