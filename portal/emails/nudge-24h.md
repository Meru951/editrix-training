Subject: Shall I save your spot?

Hi {{name}},

I noticed you haven't started Day {{day}} yet.

I know life gets busy — truly, I do. But I want to be honest with you: this programme works best when you stay in rhythm. Each day builds on the last. Fall behind, and it gets harder to catch up.

So I have a question for you:

**Are you still in?**

If yes — great. Start Day {{day}} now and you'll be back on track within the hour:

If now genuinely isn't the right time, that's okay too. Reply and let me know, and I'll pause your enrolment. No hard feelings. You can restart when life allows.

What I can't do is wait indefinitely. I need you to decide.

Diana
