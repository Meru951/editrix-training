# Day 0: Welcome Email

**Subject:** Welcome to the Proofreading Programme — Read This First

---

Hello {{name}},

Welcome. I'm Diana, and I'll be your instructor for the next 10 days.

Before we begin, let me be clear about what this is.

**THIS IS PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, NOT A CASUAL COURSE.**

I'm preparing you for real editorial work — the kind where deadlines matter and mistakes cost money. How you handle this programme tells me how you'll handle real assignments.

---

**WHAT I EXPECT FROM YOU:**

1. **Complete each day's work within 24 hours.** Life happens — if something comes up, tell me. Silence is not acceptable.

2. **Aim for accuracy.** Speed matters, but not at the expense of quality. Take the time to get it right.

3. **Finish what you start.** The certificate goes to those who reach the standard. Partial completion earns nothing.

**HOW THE CERTIFICATE WORKS:**

You earn a **Skill Certificate** when you score **90% or above**.

- Below 90%? You can **retake** as many times as you need.
- No limit on attempts. Keep going until you get there.
- The certificate means you're ready for professional work. I don't give it out lightly.

**Grading breakdown:**
- Accuracy: 50%
- Speed: 30%
- Commitment (on-time submissions): 20%

Score 90%+ and you'll be invited to join our freelance editor pool for paid work.
