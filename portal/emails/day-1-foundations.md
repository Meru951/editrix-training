# Day 1: What Proofreaders Actually Do

**Subject:** Day 1: The One Rule That Changes Everything

---

Good morning,

Here's something most people get wrong about proofreading:

This restraint is harder than it sounds.

## Quick Tip

When you spot something that isn't quite wrong but could be "better" — stop. Ask yourself: Is this an *error* or a *preference*?

Errors get marked. Preferences don't.
