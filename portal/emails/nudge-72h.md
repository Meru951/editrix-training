This is my last message before I close your enrolment.

I've sent a few notes over the past few days. I haven't heard back. I understand — sometimes that's the answer in itself.

If you've decided this isn't for you — or if life has genuinely made it impossible right now — just reply with "I'm out" and I'll close things cleanly. No judgement. You can reapply in a month if circumstances change.

I hope you come back. I think you could do this. But I need you to choose.
