Subject: {{name}}, a quick word

{{name}},

I've noticed you've gone quiet, and I wanted to reach out personally.

When you signed up, you said you wanted to learn proofreading. That took initiative. Most people just think about doing things — you actually started.

I don't know what's getting in the way right now. Maybe work exploded. Maybe energy dipped. Maybe you opened the lesson and felt overwhelmed. All of that is normal.

Here's what I know: **people who finish things are people who finish things.** That's the difference between someone who talks about becoming an editor and someone who actually becomes one. It's not talent. It's follow-through.

You have one more day to get back on track. After that, I'll need to close your enrolment — not because I'm punishing you, but because this programme only works for people who are actively doing it.

Complete Day {{day}} now — it'll take an hour:

Or reply and tell me you need to stop. I'll respect that.

But silence isn't an option I can work with.
