## ⚠️ Top 3 Struggle Areas

### 1. Which vs That (54% accuracy)
**Pattern:** Students don't understand the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive clauses.
**Common mistake:** Leaving "which" without a comma when it should have one.
**Recommendation:** Add visual diagram showing the decision tree. More examples in Stage 2.

### 2. Compound Adjectives (61% accuracy)
**Pattern:** Students don't recognize when a hyphen is needed before a noun.
**Common mistake:** "long term plans" left unhyphenated.
**Recommendation:** Create a drill specifically for compound adjectives. Add to daily exercises.

### 3. Dialogue Punctuation (68% accuracy)
**Pattern:** Confusion about comma vs full stop before speech tags.
**Common mistake:** "I'm leaving." She said. (should be comma + lowercase)
**Recommendation:** More examples in Day 4. Add a "dialogue only" exercise set.

---

## 🔴 Most Missed Errors (False Negatives)

Students missed these errors most often:

1. **Which without comma** — 23 misses across 12 students
2. **Compound adjective unhyphenated** — 19 misses
3. **Comma before "that"** — 15 misses (they didn't remove it)
4. **Dialogue full stop** — 14 misses
5. **Inconsistent spelling** — 11 misses

---

## 🟡 Most Overcorrected (False Positives)

Students incorrectly "fixed" these (they weren't errors):

1. **Stylistic comma usage** — 8 false positives
2. **Author voice quirks** — 6 false positives
3. **Acceptable spelling variants** — 5 false positives
4. **Optional hyphenation** — 4 false positives

**Insight:** Students tend to over-edit. They need to learn when to leave things alone.

## ⏱️ Time vs Accuracy

| Speed | Accuracy | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Under 30 min | 72% | Rushing hurts accuracy |
| 30-45 min | 86% | Sweet spot |
| 45-60 min | 88% | Diminishing returns |
| Over 60 min | 84% | Fatigue kicks in |

**Recommendation:** Encourage 30-45 minute sessions. Break longer exercises into chunks.

---

## 📈 Learning Curves

### Typical Student Progression
- **Day 1-2:** 70-75% accuracy (baseline)
- **Day 3-4:** 75-80% (punctuation rules click)
- **Day 5-6:** 78-82% (consistency is hard)
- **Day 7-8:** 82-88% (integration challenges)
- **Day 9-10:** 85-92% (speed + confidence)

### Plateau Point
Most students plateau around **Day 5-6** during consistency exercises. This is where we lose the most students.

**Recommendation:** Add encouragement email on Day 5. "You're halfway there. This is the hardest part. Push through."

---

## 📧 Nudge Effectiveness

| Nudge | Response Rate | Completion After |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| 12h gentle reminder | 60% respond | 55% complete |
| 24h "Are you still in?" | 45% respond | 40% complete |
| 48h identity appeal | 30% respond | 28% complete |
| 72h final warning | 15% respond | 12% complete |

**Best performer:** The 24h "Are you still in?" nudge has the highest conversion — giving people a choice works.

## 🤖 Insights for Mary (AI Proofreader)

### What Mary should flag with HIGH confidence:
- Compound adjectives (humans miss 39% of these)
- Which/that errors (humans miss 46%)
- Dialogue punctuation (humans miss 32%)

### What Mary should flag with LOWER confidence:
- Stylistic comma usage (humans overcorrect 8% of correct text)
- Author voice quirks (not errors, but humans "fix" them)
- Optional hyphens (house style dependent)

### Query suggestions for Mary:
When flagging which/that:
> "Consider: Is this clause essential to the meaning (use 'that', no comma) or additional information (use 'which' with commas)?"

When flagging compound adjectives:
> "When two words work together to describe a noun, they usually need a hyphen: 'long-term plans', 'well-known author'."

## 💡 Curriculum Recommendations

1. **Add which/that decision tree** — Visual aid for Stage 2
2. **Create compound adjective drill** — 20 extra practice items
3. **Split dialogue exercise** — Separate comma/period rules from quote placement
4. **Add Day 5 encouragement email** — Combat the consistency plateau
5. **Reduce Stage 3 exercise length** — Break into smaller chunks

---

## 📅 Next Week Focus

1. Implement which/that visual guide
2. Monitor new students for early struggle signals
3. Test new nudge wording for 48h message
4. Review Mary's flagging against human accuracy patterns
