      "content_file": "day-01-what-is-proofreading.md",
      "focus": "Understanding scope",
      "why": "If you don't understand where proofreading ends and copy-editing begins, you'll overstep — or underdeliver.",

        "Proofreading vs copy-editing vs editing",
        "The proof stage in publishing workflow",

      "focus": "The physical skill of markup",
      "why": "Spotting errors means nothing if you can't communicate them clearly. The typesetter reads your marks, not your mind.",

        "-ise vs -ize (Hart's: both acceptable, but be consistent)",
        "-our vs -or (British: colour, honour)",
