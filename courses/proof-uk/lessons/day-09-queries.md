# Day 9: Queries — When to Ask, Not Fix

---

A proofreader who changes everything is dangerous. A proofreader who asks the right questions is invaluable.

Today you learn when to fix and when to query.

---

## The Difference

| Correction | Query |
|------------|-------|
| You're certain it's wrong | You're uncertain |
| There's only one right answer | There might be multiple valid options |
| Fixing it can't introduce a new error | Fixing it might change the author's meaning |
| It's within proofreading scope | It might be copy-editing territory |

---

## When to Correct (Red)

Correct without querying when:

### 1. Obvious Typos

> "teh" → "the"
> "recieve" → "receive"

### 2. Doubled Words

> "the the cat" → "the cat"

### 3. Missing Punctuation That Creates Nonsense

> "Let's eat Grandma" → "Let's eat, Grandma"

### 4. Clear Inconsistencies with Established Style

> "realise" throughout, then suddenly "realize" once

### 5. Layout Errors

> Wrong page number
> Missing chapter heading
> Broken running head

---

## When to Query (Yellow)

Query when:

### 1. You're Not Sure If It's an Error

> "She walked slow down the path."

Is "slow" an error (should be "slowly")? Or is it dialect/voice?

**Query:** "AU: 'slow' — should this be 'slowly', or is this intentional for voice?"

### 2. Both Options Seem Valid

> "grey" or "gray"?

If neither is established as the book's preference:

**Query:** "AU: Please confirm preferred spelling — 'grey' or 'gray'."

### 3. It Might Be Intentional

> A character says: "I ain't going nowhere."

This is probably intentional dialect. Don't correct it. If you're worried:

**Query:** "AU: Confirming 'ain't going nowhere' is intentional dialect."

### 4. The "Correction" Would Change Meaning

> "She literally exploded with anger."

You might think "literally" is wrong here. But:
- It's increasingly accepted in informal use
- The author chose it
- Changing it is copy-editing, not proofreading

If it bothers you:

**Query:** "AU: 'literally' used figuratively here — intentional?"

### 5. Facts You Can't Verify

> "Einstein was born in 1879."

You could check this. But:
- What if you're wrong?
- What if it's a fictional Einstein?

If you have concerns:

**Query:** "AU: Please verify date of birth."

## How to Write a Good Query

### Be Specific

❌ "Something seems wrong here."
✓ "AU: 'grey' on p. 23 vs 'gray' here. Please confirm preferred spelling."

### Be Neutral

❌ "This sentence is terrible and needs rewriting."
✓ "AU: Sentence structure unclear — please review."

### Be Actionable

❌ "Check this."
✓ "AU: 'Catherine' on p. 5, 'Katherine' here. Please confirm correct spelling."

### Use Standard Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **AU** | Author query — needs author's decision |
| **ED** | Editor query — needs editor's decision |
| **PUB** | Publisher query — needs publisher's decision |
| **STET** | Leave as is — ignore previous correction |

---

## The Query Format

A good query follows this pattern:

> **[CODE]: [What you found] — [What you need]**

Examples:

> AU: 'Mr Bennett' here but 'Mr. Bennett' on p. 12. Please confirm preferred style.

> AU: Character's age given as 35 on p. 23 but 37 here. Please verify.

> ED: Orphan line at top of page. Move text or adjust?

> AU: Historical reference to 'King George' without numeral. Intentional?

## The Proofreader's Humility

Remember:

1. **You might be wrong.** The author might know something you don't.
2. **Context matters.** What looks wrong to you might be right in this story.
3. **Authors make choices.** Not all unusual usage is an error.
4. **Your job is to help, not to impose.** Query first, correct only when certain.

## Common Query Situations

### Timeline Inconsistencies

> Character's birthday is March in chapter 1, April in chapter 10.

**Query:** "AU: Sarah's birthday — March (p. 15) or April (p. 150)? Please clarify."

### Name Changes

> Character introduced as "Dr. James Smith" later called "Professor Smith."

**Query:** "AU: Dr. Smith (p. 5) or Professor Smith (p. 80)? Please confirm correct title."

### Historical/Factual Details

> Story set in 1920 mentions "watching television."

**Query:** "AU: Television in 1920 — intentional anachronism or error?"

### Unclear Pronoun Reference

> "John told Michael that he was wrong."

**Query:** "AU: 'he' refers to John or Michael? Please clarify."

### Possible Missing Text

> "She opened the door and"

Sentence ends abruptly.

**Query:** "AU: Sentence appears incomplete. Text missing?"

## The Query Mindset

Ask yourself:

1. **Am I certain this is wrong?** → Correct it.
2. **Am I uncertain?** → Query it.
3. **Could I be wrong?** → Query it.
4. **Is this my call to make?** → If no, query it.

## Today's Exercise

For each item, decide: **Correct** or **Query**? If query, write the query.

1. "The cat sat on teh mat."
2. "She was born in 1985" (but earlier text says 1983).
3. "I don't got no time for that."
4. "Colour" on page 10, "color" on page 50.
5. "The meeting is on 15th January, 2026."
6. "Einstein's theory of relativity was published in 1915."
7. "She walked slow towards the door."
8. Missing full stop at end of paragraph.
9. "Catherine" in chapter 1, "Katherine" in chapter 10.
10. "The 1920's were a time of change."

## Answers

1. **Correct** — "teh" → "the" (obvious typo)

2. **Query** — "AU: Birth year given as 1985 here but 1983 on p. [X]. Please confirm."

3. **Query** — "AU: 'don't got no' — intentional dialect or error?"

4. **Query** — "AU: 'colour' (p. 10) and 'color' (p. 50) — please confirm preferred spelling."

5. **Correct** — "15th January, 2026" → "15 January 2026" (standard format, no ordinal, no comma)

6. **Query** — "AU: Relativity published 1915 — please verify." (General relativity was 1915; special was 1905. Depends on context.)

7. **Query** — "AU: 'walked slow' — should this be 'slowly', or intentional for voice?"

8. **Correct** — Missing full stop is always an error.

9. **Query** — "AU: Catherine (ch. 1) or Katherine (ch. 10)? Please confirm correct spelling."

10. **Correct** — "1920's" → "1920s" (no apostrophe in decades)

*The best proofreaders know what they don't know. Query when uncertain.*
