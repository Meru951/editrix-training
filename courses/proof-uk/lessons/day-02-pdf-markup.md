# Day 2: Marking Up a PDF

---

Yesterday you learned what proofreading is. Today you learn how to do it.

Spotting errors is only half the job. The other half is **communicating them clearly**. A typesetter will open your marked-up PDF and make exactly the changes you indicated. If your marks are unclear, they'll guess. Guesses become errors. Errors get printed.

**Your marks are instructions. Make them unambiguous.**

---

## Why PDF?

You might wonder: why don't we work in Word?

Because at the proof stage, the book has already been designed and typeset. The Word document is ancient history. The PDF shows **exactly how the printed book will look** — the fonts, the line breaks, the page breaks, the layout.

When you proofread a PDF, you're checking:
- Did the typesetter introduce new errors?
- Did earlier errors slip through copy-editing?
- Is everything consistent across pages?

If you worked in Word, the text would reflow differently on every computer. A line break in your version might not exist in the typesetter's version. Your marks wouldn't match their layout.

**PDF is fixed. What you see is what prints.**

---

## Why Colour?

Professional publishing uses colour to signal intent:

| Colour | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Red/Pink** | Correction | "This is wrong and must be fixed" |
| **Yellow** | Query | "I'm not sure — please check" |
| **Blue** | Note | "FYI — not a correction request" |

Why does this matter?

A typesetter scanning your marked PDF will **prioritise red marks** — those are definite fixes. Yellow marks go to the editor for a decision. If you mark everything in red, you're making decisions above your pay grade. If you mark everything in yellow, you're not doing your job.

**The discipline of colour is the discipline of judgment.**

When you're certain something is wrong: **red**.
When you're asking a question: **yellow**.

## Your Tools: Adobe Acrobat Reader DC

Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is free and industry-standard. You can download it at: https://get.adobe.com/reader/

### Opening the Comment Toolbar

1. Open your PDF in Adobe Reader
2. Click **View** in the menu bar
3. Select **Tools → Comment → Open**

A toolbar appears on the right side of your screen. These are your proofreading tools.

### The Tools You'll Use

| Tool | What It Looks Like | When to Use |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Highlight** | Marker pen icon | Mark text that needs attention |
| **Strikethrough** | ABC with line through | Mark text for deletion |
| **Replace Text** | Strikethrough + caret | Mark text to be replaced |
| **Insert Text** | Caret symbol (^) | Mark where to add text |
| **Sticky Note** | Speech bubble | Add a comment or query |

### Setting Your Colours

Right-click on any tool to change its default colour:
- Set **Highlight** to pink (corrections) or yellow (queries)
- Set **Strikethrough** to red
- Set **Sticky Notes** to yellow

## How to Mark: Five Common Corrections

### 1. Deleting Text

**The error:** "the the cat sat on the mat"

**How to mark:**
1. Select the extra "the " (include the space after it)
2. Click the **Strikethrough** tool
3. The word appears with a red line through it

**What the typesetter understands:** "Delete this word."

---

### 2. Inserting Text

**The error:** "I went shop" (missing word)

**How to mark:**
1. Click exactly where the missing word should go (between "went" and "shop")
2. Click the **Insert Text** tool (caret)
3. Type the missing word: "to the"

**What the typesetter understands:** "Insert 'to the' at this point."

---

### 3. Replacing Text

**The error:** "recieve" (spelling mistake)

**How to mark:**
1. Select the incorrect word
2. Click **Replace Text** (strikethrough with caret)
3. Type the correct spelling: "receive"

**What the typesetter understands:** "Change 'recieve' to 'receive'."

---

### 4. Raising a Query

**The situation:** The text says "grey" but earlier in the book it said "gray". You're not sure which is correct for this book.

**How to mark:**
1. Highlight the word in **yellow**
2. Add a **Sticky Note** (also yellow)
3. Type: "AU: 'grey' vs 'gray' — page 12 used 'gray'. Please confirm preferred spelling."

**What the typesetter understands:** "This needs a decision from the author or editor before I change anything."

**Note:** "AU" means Author Query. Other codes you'll see:
- ED = Editor Query
- STET = Leave as is (ignore a previous mark)

---

### 5. Closing Up Space

**The error:** "some thing" (should be one word)

**How to mark:**
1. Select the space between "some" and "thing"
2. Use **Strikethrough** on the space
3. Or add a **Sticky Note**: "Close up to 'something'"

---

## The Three-Pass Method

Don't try to catch everything in one read. You'll miss things.

**Pass 1: Read for Sense**
Read the page without marking anything. Just understand what the text is saying. If something confuses you, note it mentally.

**Pass 2: Mark Errors**
Now go through slowly. Mark each error as you find it. Use the correct tool. Use the correct colour.

**Pass 3: Review Your Marks**
Look at every mark you made and ask:
- Is it clear what I want changed?
- Would a stranger understand this instruction?
- Is the colour right? (Red = certain. Yellow = question.)
- Did I accidentally mark something that's actually correct?

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Marking style choices as errors**
"Grey" and "gray" are both correct. Check what the book uses before marking either as wrong.

**2. Vague instructions**
❌ "Fix this"
✓ "Change 'accomodate' to 'accommodate'"

**3. Marking the wrong spot**
If your highlight covers the wrong word, the typesetter will change the wrong word. Be precise.

**4. Over-marking**
If you've marked 50 things on one page, you're probably overstepping. Proofreading is not rewriting.

## Today's Exercise

I've attached a practice PDF with **10 deliberate errors**.

Your task:
1. Download the PDF
2. Open it in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC
3. Find and mark all 10 errors
4. Use the correct tools and colours
5. Save your marked-up PDF
6. Email it back to me

I'll review your markup and give you feedback on:
- Did you find all the errors?
- Are your marks clear?
- Did you use the right tools?

---

## Remember

The typesetter cannot read your mind. They can only read your marks.

Make every mark count.
