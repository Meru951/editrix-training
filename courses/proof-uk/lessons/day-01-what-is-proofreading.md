# Day 1: What Proofreading Is (And Isn't)

---

Before you mark a single error, you need to understand what you're being paid to do — and what you're not.

Get this wrong, and you'll either miss things you should have caught, or waste time fixing things that aren't your job. Both will cost you work.

## The Publishing Workflow

A book goes through several stages before it reaches readers:

1. **Writing** — The author creates the manuscript
2. **Developmental editing** — Big-picture feedback on structure, plot, character
3. **Copy-editing** — Line-by-line work on grammar, style, consistency
4. **Typesetting** — The text is laid out in its final design
5. **Proofreading** — You check the typeset pages for errors ← **This is you**
6. **Printing** — The book goes to press

**You are the last line of defence.** After you, there's no one else. Every error you miss gets printed.

## What Proofreading IS

Your job is to catch:

### 1. Typesetting Errors
The typesetter may have introduced new errors when laying out the book:
- Text accidentally deleted or duplicated
- Wrong font or font size
- Bad line breaks or hyphenation
- Headers or page numbers wrong

### 2. Errors That Slipped Through
Previous editors may have missed:
- Spelling mistakes
- Punctuation errors
- Inconsistent spelling (grey/gray, realise/realize)
- Missing or repeated words

### 3. Layout Problems
- Widows and orphans (single lines stranded on a page)
- Incorrect paragraph spacing
- Missing chapter headings
- Misaligned text

## What Proofreading IS NOT

Your job is **not** to:

### ❌ Rewrite sentences
If a sentence is awkward but grammatically correct, leave it. That was the author's choice.

**Not your call:** "She walked quickly to the door" → "She hurried to the door"

### ❌ Change style
If the author uses short sentences for effect, don't combine them. If they prefer "whilst" to "while", don't change it.

**Not your call:** "He stopped. He stared. He ran." → "He stopped, stared, and ran."

### ❌ Impose your preferences
You might prefer the Oxford comma. The author might not use it. Follow the book's established style.

**Not your call:** Adding commas where the author consistently omits them.

### ❌ Rewrite dialogue
Dialogue reflects character voice. A character might speak ungrammatically on purpose.

**Not your call:** "I ain't going nowhere" → "I'm not going anywhere"

## The Key Question

Before you mark anything, ask yourself:

> **"Is this an error, or is it a choice?"**

- **Errors** get corrected (red marks)
- **Choices** get left alone
- **Uncertainties** get queried (yellow marks)

---

## When to Query

If you're not sure whether something is an error or a choice, **query it**.

A query is a polite question to the author or editor:

> "AU: 'grey' used here, but 'gray' on p. 23. Please confirm preferred spelling."

Queries are not corrections. They're requests for clarification.

**Better to query than to guess.** A wrong guess introduces an error. A query gets the right answer.

## The Proofreader's Boundaries

| You CAN correct | You CANNOT correct |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Spelling errors | Stylistic choices |
| Punctuation errors | Deliberate fragments |
| Typos | Dialect or voice |
| Inconsistencies | Sentence structure |
| Missing words | Word choice |
| Layout problems | Tone or emphasis |

---

## Why This Matters

Publishers hire proofreaders they can trust. Trust means:

1. **You catch what needs catching** — Nothing slips through
2. **You don't overstep** — You know your boundaries
3. **You query appropriately** — You ask when unsure

A proofreader who misses errors is unreliable.
A proofreader who changes too much is dangerous.
A proofreader who knows the difference is invaluable.

## Today's Exercise

Look at the following 10 items. For each one, decide:
- **A)** Proofreading correction (fix it)
- **B)** Copy-editing territory (not your job)
- **C)** Query (ask the author/editor)

1. "recieve" for "receive"
2. "She walked slow down the path"
3. "grey" on page 10, "gray" on page 50
4. "He don't know nothing" (character dialogue)
5. "the the cat sat on the mat"
6. "It was a dark and stormy night—" to "It was stormy and dark—"
7. Missing full stop at end of paragraph
8. "Mr. Smith" on page 5, "Mr Smith" on page 20
9. "She literally exploded with anger"
10. Page number says "52" but should be "53"

---

## Answers

1. **A) Correction** — "recieve" is a spelling error
2. **B) Copy-editing** — "slow" might be intentional voice (though grammatically "slowly")
3. **C) Query** — Ask which spelling is preferred
4. **B) Not your job** — This is dialect in dialogue
5. **A) Correction** — Doubled word is always an error
6. **B) Copy-editing** — That's rewriting, not proofreading
7. **A) Correction** — Missing punctuation is an error
8. **C) Query** — Ask for consistent style (Mr. or Mr)
9. **B) Copy-editing** — "Literally" usage is style, not your call
10. **A) Correction** — Wrong page number is a layout error
