# Day 4: Punctuation — Dialogue

---

Dialogue is where your readers hear the characters. Get the punctuation wrong, and you break the spell.

British and American conventions differ here. Today you learn the British way.

---

## The Basic Rule: Single Quotes

In British English, dialogue uses **single quotation marks**:

> 'I'm leaving,' she said.

**Not:**
> "I'm leaving," she said. ← This is American style

---

## Quotes Within Quotes

When a character quotes someone else, use **double quotation marks** inside the single quotes:

> 'He told me, "I'm leaving," and then he left.'

The outer dialogue is in single quotes. The inner quote is in double quotes.

---

## Punctuation Placement: The Logical System

This is where British and American styles differ most.

**British style** (logical punctuation): Punctuation goes **inside** the quotes only if it's part of what's being quoted.

**American style**: Punctuation almost always goes inside the quotes.

### British Examples:

**Inside** (part of the dialogue):
> 'I'm leaving,' she said.
> 'Where are you going?' he asked.
> 'Stop!' she shouted.

The comma, question mark, and exclamation mark are part of what the character said.

**Outside** (not part of the dialogue):
> Did he really say 'I'm leaving'?
> She used the word 'bizarre'.
> I hate when people say 'literally'.

The question mark isn't part of the quote — the narrator is asking the question. The full stop isn't part of the word 'bizarre'.

## Dialogue Tags

A **dialogue tag** tells us who's speaking: *she said, he asked, they whispered*.

### Comma Before the Tag

If the dialogue is a statement, use a **comma** before the tag:

> 'I'm leaving,' she said.

**Not:**
> 'I'm leaving.' She said. ← Wrong: "She said" isn't a complete sentence

### No Comma for Questions and Exclamations

If the dialogue ends with a question mark or exclamation mark, don't add a comma:

> 'Are you coming?' he asked.

**Not:**
> 'Are you coming?,' he asked. ← Wrong: Don't double up punctuation

### Capital Letters After Tags

If the tag comes in the middle of a sentence, don't capitalise the continuation:

> 'I'm leaving,' she said, 'and I'm not coming back.'

**Not:**
> 'I'm leaving,' she said, 'And I'm not coming back.' ← Wrong: "And" shouldn't be capitalised

### But Capitalise a New Sentence

If the dialogue after the tag is a new sentence:

> 'I'm leaving,' she said. 'Don't follow me.'

Here, "Don't follow me" is a new sentence, so it gets a capital D.

---

## Action Beats vs Dialogue Tags

An **action beat** is an action, not a tag. It gets a full stop:

> 'I'm leaving.' She grabbed her coat.

"She grabbed her coat" is not a dialogue tag — it's an action. Use a full stop, not a comma.

Compare:
> 'I'm leaving,' she said. ← Tag (comma)
> 'I'm leaving.' She grabbed her coat. ← Action (full stop)

## The Most Common Errors

### 1. Wrong Quote Style

❌ "I'm leaving," she said. ← American style
✓ 'I'm leaving,' she said. ← British style

### 2. Full Stop Instead of Comma

❌ 'I'm leaving.' She said.
✓ 'I'm leaving,' she said.

### 3. Comma with Question/Exclamation

❌ 'Where are you going?,' he asked.
✓ 'Where are you going?' he asked.

### 4. Missing Comma Before Tag

❌ 'I'm leaving' she said.
✓ 'I'm leaving,' she said.

### 5. Wrong Capitalisation

❌ 'I'm leaving,' She said.
✓ 'I'm leaving,' she said.

### 6. Punctuation Outside When It Should Be Inside

❌ 'I'm leaving', she said.
✓ 'I'm leaving,' she said.

## Interrupted Dialogue

When dialogue is cut off:

**Interrupted by action:**
> 'I was just—' She stopped abruptly.

Use an em-dash with no space before it.

**Trailing off:**
> 'I was just…'

Use an ellipsis (three dots).

---

## Multiple Paragraphs of Dialogue

If one character speaks for multiple paragraphs:

1. **Open** each paragraph with a quotation mark
2. **Don't close** the quotation mark until the speech ends
3. **Close** only the final paragraph

> 'I remember the day we met. You were standing by the window, looking out at the rain.
>
> 'I thought you were the most beautiful person I'd ever seen.
>
> 'And I was right.'

Notice: Opening quote on each paragraph, closing quote only at the end.

## Today's Exercise

Correct the dialogue punctuation in this passage:

> "I can't believe you said that," She whispered.
> "Said what?" He asked.
> "You know what". She turned away. "You told him I was "unreliable"."
> "I never said that," he protested. "I said you were unpredictable."
> "That's even worse"! She grabbed her bag, "I'm leaving".

---

## Answers

**Corrected:**

> 'I can't believe you said that,' she whispered.
> 'Said what?' he asked.
> 'You know what.' She turned away. 'You told him I was "unreliable".'
> 'I never said that,' he protested. 'I said you were unpredictable.'
> 'That's even worse!' She grabbed her bag. 'I'm leaving.'

**Errors found:**
1. Double quotes → single quotes (British style)
2. "She whispered" → "she whispered" (lowercase after comma)
3. "He asked" → "he asked" (lowercase after question mark)
4. Full stop outside quote → inside
5. Exclamation mark outside → inside
6. Comma after action beat → full stop ("She grabbed her bag.")
7. Full stop outside final quote → inside
