# Day 10: Full Proof — Putting It All Together

---

You've learned the pieces. Now prove you can do the whole job.

Today is your final assessment. You'll proofread a complete manuscript excerpt using everything you've learned.

## The Professional Workflow

Before you start, remember the complete process:

### Step 1: First Read

Read the entire passage without marking anything. Understand:
- What is the story about?
- Who are the characters?
- What is the narrative voice?
- What style choices has the author made?

### Step 2: Create Your Style Sheet

As you read, note:
- Character names and spellings
- Place names
- Key terms
- Spelling preferences (grey/gray, realise/realize)
- Punctuation style (serial comma, quote style)
- Number treatment

### Step 3: Systematic Proofread

Now read again, slowly, marking errors:
- Use red/pink for corrections
- Use yellow for queries
- Be thorough but stay in scope

### Step 4: Review Your Marks

Check every mark you made:
- Is it clear?
- Is it correct?
- Could it be misunderstood?

### Step 5: Final Check

- Have you maintained consistency with your style sheet?
- Have you missed anything obvious?
- Are your queries properly formatted?

## Passing Standard

To earn your certificate:

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Pass** | 90%+ | Ready for professional work |
| **Retake** | 70–89% | Good effort, needs more practice |
| **Retake** | Below 70% | Review lessons, try again |

There is no limit on retakes. The goal is mastery.

## Time Limit

Professional proofreaders work at approximately:

- **10 pages per hour** for fiction
- **5–8 pages per hour** for complex non-fiction

For this assessment:
- The passage is approximately 5 pages
- Suggested time: 30–45 minutes
- Maximum time: 60 minutes

Speed matters, but accuracy matters more. It's better to take longer and get it right.

## Final Reminders

### Remember Your Boundaries

✓ Correct errors
✗ Don't rewrite
✓ Query uncertainties
✗ Don't impose your preferences

### Remember Your Tools

- **Strikethrough** for deletions
- **Insert** for additions
- **Replace** for substitutions
- **Highlight + Note** for queries

### Remember Your Colours

- **Red/Pink** = Correction (you're certain)
- **Yellow** = Query (you're asking)

### Remember Your Mindset

- You are the last line of defence
- Every error you miss gets printed
- But every wrong "correction" is an error you created
- When in doubt, query
