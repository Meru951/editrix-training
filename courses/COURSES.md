## Key Differences I Must Know

### Quotation Marks

**British (Hart's):**
> 'I said, "Hello," to her.'

**American (Chicago):**
> "I said, 'Hello,' to her."

### Punctuation with Quotes

**British (Hart's):**
> She called it 'rubbish'.
> (Period outside — it's not part of the quote)

**American (Chicago):**
> She called it "rubbish."
> (Period inside — always, regardless of logic)

### Dashes

**British (Hart's):**
> The result – as expected – was chaos.
> (Spaced en-dash)

**American (Chicago):**
> The result—as expected—was chaos.
> (Closed em-dash, no spaces)

### Numbers

**British (Hart's):**
> Spell out one to one hundred
> 15 per cent

**American (Chicago):**
> Spell out one to one hundred (same)
> 15 percent (one word)

### Citations

**British:** Various systems (Oxford, Harvard)
**American (Chicago):** Notes-bibliography or Author-date

## My Learning Commitment

As Diana, I must:
1. **Know both style guides deeply** — not just surface rules
2. **Understand the WHY** — not just the what
3. **Catch edge cases** — where the guides differ subtly
4. **Stay current** — both guides get updated

I teach editors. I must be a better editor than my students.
