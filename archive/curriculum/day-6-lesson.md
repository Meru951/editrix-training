# Day 6: Consistency — Names and Terms

---

The reader trusts you. When "Catherine" becomes "Katherine" on page 147, that trust cracks. When "grey" becomes "gray" halfway through, the reader stumbles.

Your job is to catch every inconsistency before the reader does.

---

## Why Consistency Matters

Inconsistencies signal carelessness. They pull readers out of the story. They make your publisher look unprofessional.

One small inconsistency seems minor. Fifty small inconsistencies across a book become a pattern of sloppiness.

---

## What to Track

### 1. Character Names

**Spelling:**
> Is it Catherine or Katherine?
> Is it Mr. Bennet or Mr Bennett?
> Is it Elisabeth or Elizabeth?

**Capitalisation:**
> Is it the Doctor or the doctor?
> Is it Mum or mum?

**Titles:**
> Is it Dr Smith or Dr. Smith?
> Is it Mrs Dalloway or Mrs. Dalloway?

### 2. Place Names

> Is it Longbourn or Longbourne?
> Is it St Pancras or St. Pancras?
> Is it the Lake District or the lake district?

### 3. Terms and Objects

> Is it grey or gray?
> Is it whisky or whiskey?
> Is it towards or toward?
> Is it phone or 'phone?

### 4. Spellings

> Is it realise or realize?
> Is it colour or color?
> Is it travelled or traveled?

## The Style Sheet

Professional proofreaders keep a **style sheet** while they work. This is a running list of every choice the manuscript makes.

### Sample Style Sheet

```
NAMES
Catherine (not Katherine) — p. 3
Mr Bennet (no full stop after Mr) — p. 1
Elisabeth Bennet (not Elizabeth) — p. 5

PLACES
Longbourn (not Longbourne) — p. 2
St Pancras (no full stop) — p. 45

TERMS
grey (not gray) — p. 7
whisky (not whiskey) — p. 23

SPELLING
realise, organised, colour (British -ise, -our) — throughout
travelled (double l) — p. 12

STYLE
No Oxford comma — throughout
Spaced en-dash for parenthetical — p. 8
Single quotes for dialogue — throughout
```

### How to Build Your Style Sheet

1. Start on page 1
2. Note the first occurrence of every variable spelling, name, or term
3. Record the page number
4. Check every subsequent occurrence against your sheet
5. Flag any deviations

## Common Consistency Traps

### 1. Names That Look Similar

Authors sometimes accidentally change spellings:
> Stephen → Steven
> Sarah → Sara
> Philippe → Philip

### 2. Titles

British style often omits the full stop after titles:
> Mr Smith ✓
> Mr. Smith ✓
> But not both in the same book.

### 3. Compound Words

Is it:
> book-shop, bookshop, or book shop?
> e-mail, email, or E-mail?
> on-line, online, or on line?

Pick one. Use it throughout.

### 4. Numbers

Spelled out or figures?
> twenty-three or 23?
> five thousand or 5,000?

### 5. Time and Date Formats

> 3pm, 3 pm, 3 p.m., 3PM?
> 1 January, January 1, 1st January?

## What to Do When You Find an Inconsistency

### If There's a Clear Majority:

If "Catherine" appears 47 times and "Katherine" appears once, that one is probably a typo. Mark it for correction.

### If It's Roughly Equal:

If "grey" appears 12 times and "gray" appears 10 times, query it:

> "AU: 'grey' and 'gray' both used. Please confirm preferred spelling."

### If It's a Proper Noun:

Check the official spelling. "World Health Organisation" or "World Health Organization"? The organisation itself spells it with a 'z'.

## The First-Occurrence Rule

The first occurrence usually sets the style. If the first appearance of a character's name is "Catherine," later appearances of "Katherine" are probably errors.

But verify:
- Is there more than one character?
- Did the author change their mind? (Query if unclear)
- Is it a deliberate variation? (Nicknames, etc.)

## Today's Exercise

Create a style sheet from this passage and identify all inconsistencies:

> Catherine Bennet arrived at Longbourn on a grey morning. Her sister Elisabeth was waiting by the window. Mr. Bennett had gone to town, leaving Mrs Bennet to manage the household.
>
> "I've organised everything," Elisabeth said. "The gray curtains are hung, the whiskey is poured, and Dr Smith is expected at 3pm."
>
> Katherine smiled. "You've thought of everything."
>
> They walked towards the garden, past the book-shop on the corner. It was now 3 pm, and they could see Dr. Smith approaching Longbourne.
