# Day 3: Spelling and House Style

---

Yesterday you learned how to mark errors. Today you learn what counts as an error in the first place.

The answer isn't always obvious. Is "colour" correct, or "color"? Is "realise" right, or "realize"?

It depends on the **house style**.

---

## Why House Style Exists

Publishers need consistency. A book that switches between "colour" and "color" looks unprofessional. It distracts readers and undermines trust.

**House style** is the set of rules a publisher follows for:
- Spelling preferences
- Punctuation conventions
- Number treatment
- Capitalisation

Your job is to enforce the house style — not impose your own preferences.

## British vs American Spelling

This course follows **New Hart's Rules** (Oxford), the standard guide for British English publishing.

### Key British Spelling Patterns

| British | American | Examples |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **-our** | -or | colour, honour, favour |
| **-re** | -er | centre, theatre, metre |
| **-ise/-ize** | -ize | Both acceptable in British* |
| **-yse** | -yze | analyse, paralyse |
| **-ogue** | -og | catalogue, dialogue |
| **-ence** | -ense | defence, licence (noun) |
| **-ll-** | -l- | travelled, cancelled |

*The -ise/-ize question is more complex — see below.

## The -ise/-ize Question

This is where many proofreaders get confused.

**The truth:** In British English, **both -ise and -ize are acceptable** for most words.

- "realise" ✓
- "realize" ✓
- "organise" ✓
- "organize" ✓

**However:**

1. **Consistency is mandatory.** If a book uses "realise", it must use "organise" — not "organize".

2. **Some words are ALWAYS -ise:**
   - advertise
   - advise
   - arise
   - compromise
   - despise
   - devise
   - disguise
   - enterprise
   - exercise
   - improvise
   - revise
   - supervise
   - surprise
   - televise

   These are -ise because of their etymology (not from Greek -izo).

3. **Oxford University Press prefers -ize** (hence "Oxford spelling"). But most other British publishers use -ise.

**Your action:** Check which form the book uses, then enforce consistency.

## How to Check Consistency

When you start proofreading a manuscript:

1. **Note the first few instances** of variable spellings
2. **Create a style sheet** listing the book's choices
3. **Flag any deviations** from that established pattern

Example style sheet entries:
```
realise (not realize) — established p. 3
colour (not color) — established p. 1
grey (not gray) — established p. 7
```

If you find "realize" on page 50 but "realise" was used on page 3, that's an inconsistency to mark.

## Common British Spelling Traps

Watch out for these frequently confused pairs:

| Correct (British) | Common Error | Note |
|-------------------|--------------|------|
| grey | gray | "Gray" is American |
| judgement | judgment | Both acceptable, but be consistent |
| ageing | aging | British preference |
| acknowledgement | acknowledgment | British preference |
| enquiry | inquiry | "Enquiry" for asking, "inquiry" for investigation (British) |
| licence (n) / license (v) | license (both) | British distinguishes noun/verb |
| practise (v) / practice (n) | practice (both) | British distinguishes noun/verb |

---

## The Consistency Rule

**This is the most important rule in spelling:**

> **Internal consistency beats external rules.**

If a book consistently uses "gray" throughout, don't change it to "grey" just because that's the British preference. The author made a choice. Respect it.

Your job is to catch **inconsistencies** — not to impose a different standard.

**Exception:** Obvious typos are always errors. "graye" is not a choice.

---

## Proper Nouns and Names

Names follow their own rules:

- **"Mr. Bingley"** — If that's how it's spelled throughout, don't change it to "Bingly"
- **"St Pancras"** — No full stop after "St" in British place names
- **"organisation"** — But the company might be "World Health Organization" (their official spelling)

**When in doubt, check.** Brand names, place names, and proper nouns have official spellings.

## Today's Exercise

Examine this passage and identify all spelling inconsistencies:

> The theatre was full that night. Sarah organised the event beautifully, though her judgment was questioned by those who favored a more conservative approach. The grey curtains matched the color of the walls perfectly. She realised too late that she had misjudged the crowd — they preferred analyze to entertainment.

**Find:**
1. Which spelling pattern does this passage follow? (British or American, -ise or -ize)
2. Which words are inconsistent with that pattern?
3. What would you mark for correction?

---

## Answers

**Pattern:** Mixed (inconsistent)

**Inconsistencies found:**
1. "favored" — Should be "favoured" (American spelling in British text)
2. "color" — Should be "colour" (American spelling in British text)
3. "organized" — But "realised" used later (inconsistent -ise/-ize)
4. "analyze" — Should be "analyse" (American spelling)
5. "judgment" — Acceptable either way, but check book's preference

**Corrections to mark:**
- favored → favoured
- color → colour
- organized → organised (to match "realised")
- analyze → analyse
