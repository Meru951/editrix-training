# Day 5: Punctuation — Dashes and Ellipses

---

A hyphen is not a dash. An en-dash is not an em-dash. These tiny marks carry meaning, and getting them wrong is one of the most common errors in publishing.

---

## The Three Marks

| Mark | Name | Keyboard | Use |
|------|------|----------|-----|
| - | Hyphen | Regular hyphen key | Compound words |
| – | En-dash | Option+hyphen (Mac) or Alt+0150 (Windows) | Ranges, connections |
| — | Em-dash | Option+Shift+hyphen (Mac) or Alt+0151 (Windows) | Interruptions, parenthetical |

Many writers use hyphens for everything. Your job is to fix that.

---

## The Hyphen (-)

Use hyphens for:

### 1. Compound Adjectives Before Nouns
> a well-known author
> a five-year-old child
> a high-quality product

**But not after the noun:**
> the author was well known ← no hyphen
> the child was five years old ← no hyphens

### 2. Prefixes (Sometimes)
> re-cover (to cover again) vs recover (to get better)
> re-create vs recreate
> co-worker (though "coworker" is increasingly accepted)

### 3. Numbers Written as Words
> twenty-one
> forty-five
> three-quarters

---

## The En-Dash (–)

The en-dash is the width of a capital N. Use it for:

### 1. Ranges
> pages 10–25
> 1990–2020
> Monday–Friday

### 2. Connections Between Equal Items
> the London–Paris train
> a mother–daughter relationship
> the score was 3–2

### 3. In British Style: Parenthetical Statements

**British style** uses a **spaced en-dash**:
> She left – without saying goodbye – and never returned.

Note the spaces on either side.

---

## The Em-Dash (—)

The em-dash is the width of a capital M. 

### American Style
Americans use **unspaced em-dashes** for parenthetical statements:
> She left—without saying goodbye—and never returned.

### British Style
British English typically prefers the **spaced en-dash** (see above). However, if a publisher uses em-dashes, they are usually **unspaced**.

**Your job:** Check what the manuscript uses, then ensure consistency.

### Common Uses

**Interruption:**
> 'I was just—'
> 'Don't even start,' she snapped.

**Amplification:**
> He had one goal—to win.

**Dramatic pause:**
> She opened the door—and screamed.

---

## Common Errors to Catch

### 1. Hyphens Used for Ranges
❌ pages 10-25
✓ pages 10–25

### 2. Spaces Around Hyphens
❌ well - known author
✓ well-known author

### 3. Inconsistent Dash Style
❌ She left—suddenly. Later, she returned – alone.
✓ Pick one style and stick to it.

### 4. Hyphen Instead of Dash for Interruption
❌ 'I was just-'
✓ 'I was just—'

---

## Ellipses (…)

An ellipsis is three dots. Not two. Not four. Three.

### Use Ellipses For:

**1. Trailing Off**
> 'I was wondering if maybe…'

The speaker's thought fades away.

**2. Omission in Quoted Text**
> 'To be, or not to be … that is the question.'

Text has been removed.

**3. Hesitation**
> 'I … I don't know what to say.'

---

## Ellipsis Formatting

In British style, the ellipsis is typically:
- Three dots with spaces between: . . .
- Or a single ellipsis character: …
- With a space before and after: word … word

**Check the house style.** Some publishers use:
> word...word (no spaces)
> word ... word (spaces around)
> word … word (single character with spaces)

**Consistency matters more than which format is "correct".**

---

## Ellipsis + Other Punctuation

**Question trailing off:**
> 'Are you sure…?'

The question mark comes after the ellipsis.

**Sentence ending with ellipsis:**
> She walked away…

Some style guides add a fourth dot (full stop + ellipsis). Check the house style.

---

## Common Ellipsis Errors

### 1. Wrong Number of Dots
❌ He paused..
❌ He paused....
✓ He paused…

### 2. No Space Before
❌ He paused…and then continued.
✓ He paused … and then continued. (depending on style)

### 3. Comma + Ellipsis
❌ 'Well,…'
✓ 'Well…'

Don't combine a comma with an ellipsis.

## Today's Exercise

Correct the dashes and ellipses in this passage:

> The London-Paris train departed at 8-9am. Sarah - who had been waiting for hours - finally boarded. 'I thought you'd never...' she began, but James cut her off.
> 
> 'Don't say it,' he warned. He was a well known traveller, having visited 20-30 countries. 'I was just-'
> 
> 'Just what?' She had a take-it-or-leave-it attitude that he found infuriating...and attractive.

---

## Answers

**Corrected:**

> The London–Paris train departed at 8–9 a.m. Sarah – who had been waiting for hours – finally boarded. 'I thought you'd never…' she began, but James cut her off.
> 
> 'Don't say it,' he warned. He was a well-known traveller, having visited 20–30 countries. 'I was just—'
> 
> 'Just what?' She had a take-it-or-leave-it attitude that he found infuriating … and attractive.

**Corrections made:**
1. London-Paris → London–Paris (en-dash for connection)
2. 8-9am → 8–9 a.m. (en-dash for range)
3. Sarah - who → Sarah – who (en-dash, spaced, for parenthetical)
4. never... → never… (proper ellipsis)
5. well known → well-known (hyphen for compound before noun)
6. 20-30 → 20–30 (en-dash for range)
7. just- → just— (em-dash for interruption)
8. infuriating... → infuriating … (proper spacing)
