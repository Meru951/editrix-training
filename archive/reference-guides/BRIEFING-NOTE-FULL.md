**Commitment (20%)**
- Based on submission timing
- On time (within 24h): 100%
- 1 day late: 90%
- 2 days late: 80%
- 3+ days late: 70%
- Averaged across all 10 days

---

### Grade Bands

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **A** | 90%+ | Excellent. Invited to freelance pool. |
| **B** | 80-89% | Good. Passed with solid skills. |

## 5. Email Sequence

### Day 0: Welcome Email

**Subject:** Welcome to the Proofreading Programme — Read This First

**From:** Diana <diana@editrix.ai>

---

Hello [Name],

Welcome. I'm Diana, and I'll be your instructor for the next 10 days.

Before we begin, let me be clear about what this is.

**This is professional training, not a casual course.**

I'm preparing you for real editorial work — the kind where deadlines matter and mistakes cost money. How you handle this programme tells me how you'll handle real assignments.

### What I Expect From You

1. **Complete each day's work within 24 hours.** Life happens — if something comes up, tell me. Silence is not acceptable.

2. **Aim for accuracy.** Speed matters, but not at the expense of quality. Take the time to get it right.

3. **Finish what you start.** The certificate means you completed all 10 days at a professional standard. Partial completion earns nothing.

### How Grading Works

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Accuracy | 50% | Errors correctly identified |
| Speed | 30% | Completing exercises within target time |
| Commitment | 20% | Submitting work on schedule |

Late submissions lower your commitment score:
- On time: Full marks
- 1 day late: -10%
- 2 days late: -20%
- 3+ days late: -30% and a conversation about whether to continue

### What You Get If You Complete

- Certificate of completion
- Priority consideration for freelance work with Editrix
- A professional skill that pays

### Your Portal

**[Access Your Dashboard →]**

Day 1 begins tomorrow at 6:00 AM your time. Your first lesson will arrive by email, and exercises will be waiting in the portal.

I'm here if you have questions. Just reply to this email.

Let's begin.

Diana

### Day 1: First Lesson

**Subject:** Day 1: What Proofreaders Actually Do — Start Now

---

Good morning [Name],

Day 1 is live.

**Today's lesson:** What Proofreaders Actually Do  
**Estimated time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Deadline:** 24 hours from now

**[Read Today's Lesson →]**

When you've read the lesson, complete the exercises in the portal. The system tracks your time and accuracy.

A few first-day tips:
- Read the lesson fully before starting exercises
- Don't rush — accuracy matters more than speed today
- Use the chat if you're stuck (I'm here)

Tomorrow builds on this. Don't fall behind on Day 1.

**Time limit:** 45 minutes

## 6. Nudge System

### Automated Nudges

**12 hours after lesson sent, no activity:**

**Subject:** Day [X] — Don't Forget

---

[Name],

Quick check-in — have you started Day [X] yet?

You have 12 hours left to submit on time.

**[Go to Your Exercises →]**

Diana

---

**24 hours, no submission:**

**Subject:** Day [X] Is Now Late

---

[Name],

Day [X] is now late. This affects your commitment score.

Complete it today to minimise the impact on your grade.

If something's come up, reply and tell me. I'd rather know than guess.

**[Complete Day [X] →]**

Diana

---

**48 hours, no submission:**

**Subject:** [Name], I Need to Hear From You

---

[Name],

You're two days behind now.

I understand life gets busy. But I need to hear from you.

Reply to this email and tell me:
1. What's getting in the way?
2. Can you catch up in the next 24 hours?

If this isn't the right time for you, that's okay — but let me know so we can pause your enrolment rather than have you fail.

Silence is the only wrong answer.

Diana

---

**72 hours, no response:**

**Subject:** Your Enrolment Is Paused

---

[Name],

I haven't heard from you in three days.

I'm pausing your enrolment. You can resume within 7 days by replying to this email with a plan to complete.

After 7 days, your spot closes and you'd need to re-apply.

I hope everything's okay.

---

[Name],

You did it. And you did it well.

**Your Final Results:**
- Overall grade: **A**
- Accuracy: [X]%
- All submissions on time: Yes

**[View Your Certificate →]**

### What This Means

You've demonstrated exactly what we look for: accuracy, speed, and reliability. 

I'm inviting you to join our freelance editor pool. This means:
- Real manuscripts to proof
- Paid work (rates discussed separately)
- Ongoing relationship with Editrix

I'll send a separate email within 7 days with next steps and your first assignment.

Thank you for taking this seriously. It was noticed.

Diana

---

### Outcome B: Passed with B Grade

**Subject:** You Passed — Certificate Enclosed

---

[Name],

Congratulations. You've completed the Proofreading Programme.

**Your Final Results:**
- Overall grade: **B**
- Accuracy: [X]%
- Days on time: [X]/10

**[View Your Certificate →]**

### What This Means

You have a solid foundation in proofreading. You can:
- Spot common errors confidently
- Handle punctuation and dialogue
- Build basic style sheets
- Work under deadline pressure

### What Happens Next

B-grade graduates aren't automatically added to our freelance pool, but you're on our radar. Keep practising, and if we have overflow work or entry-level projects, I may reach out.

In the meantime, your certificate is valid and real. Use it.

Well done.

Diana

---

### Outcome C: Passed with C Grade

**Subject:** You Passed — With Notes

---

[Name],

You've completed the Proofreading Programme.

**Your Final Results:**
- Overall grade: **C**
- Accuracy: [X]%
- Days on time: [X]/10

**[View Your Certificate →]**

### Honest Feedback

You passed, but you're not ready for professional work yet. A few things held you back:

[Specific feedback: e.g., "Your accuracy dropped significantly under time pressure" or "Several late submissions affected your commitment score"]

### My Recommendation

Before taking on paid work:
- Revisit the exercises you scored lowest on
- Practice on your own writing or free texts online
- Consider retaking the programme in 60 days

Your certificate shows completion, which is something. But I'd encourage more practice before putting yourself forward for client work.

Keep going.

Diana

---

### Outcome D: Failed

**Subject:** Your Results — And Options

---

[Name],

You've completed the programme, but your final score didn't meet the passing threshold.

**Your Results:**
- Overall accuracy: [X]%
- Required to pass: 70%

### Your Options

1. **Retake the final assessment** — One attempt, within 7 days. You keep your lesson progress.

2. **Restart the programme** — From Day 1, fresh attempt, in 30 days.

Many people pass on their second try. The material is the same — you just need more practice.

Reply to let me know which you'd prefer.

Diana

---

### Outcome E: Did Not Complete

**Subject:** Your Enrolment Has Closed

---

[Name],

Your enrolment in the Proofreading Programme has closed due to inactivity.

You completed [X] of 10 days.

I understand things come up. If you'd like to try again when circumstances allow, you're welcome to re-apply in 30 days.

Take care.

## Questions for Meru

1. **Pricing:** Stay free, or introduce a fee? (Fee might filter for seriousness)
2. **Cohorts:** Rolling enrollment, or fixed start dates?
3. **Capacity:** How many students can I support at once via chat?
4. **Freelance pool:** What's the actual process after someone gets an A?
5. **Re-enrolment:** 30 days wait for dropouts — too long? Too short?

---

## Summary

**The programme in one sentence:**  
A 10-day professional training that filters for commitment, teaches real skills, and identifies editors worth hiring.

**The tone:**  
Kind but firm. Professional. No apologising for having standards.

**The outcome:**  
Students who complete are ready to work. Students who don't complete have self-selected out.
