# Chicago Manual of Style — Fiction Rules

## What I Know (Need to Verify)

### Dialogue

**Quotation marks:** Double for speech, single for nested
> "I heard him say, 'Get out,' and then he left."

**Punctuation placement:** Always inside closing quotes
> "I'm leaving."
> She called it "rubbish." (American: period inside, even though it's the narrator's)

**Comma with speech tags:**
> "I'm tired," he said.

**Period with action beats:**
> "I'm tired." He rubbed his eyes.

### Interrupted Speech

**Em-dash, closed (no space):**
> "I was going to—"
> "Don't," she interrupted.

### Trailing Off

**Ellipsis rules (Chicago-specific):**
- Trailing off mid-sentence: three dots
  > "I thought maybe . . ."
  
- Complete sentence trailing off: period + three dots (four total)
  > "I don't know. . . ."

**Chicago's ellipsis style:** Spaces between dots (. . .) OR closed (...) depending on house style

### Thoughts

**Chicago recommends:** Italics, no quotation marks
> *I should leave now,* she thought.

Not:
> 'I should leave now,' she thought.

### Em-Dash Usage

**Parenthetical:** Closed, no spaces
> The truth—and he knew this—was hard to accept.

**Interruption in dialogue:** Same
> "I was going to—"

**Amplification/explanation:**
> She had one goal—escape.

### Numbers in Fiction

**Spell out:**
- One to one hundred (general rule)
- In dialogue, often spell out more for naturalness
  > "I've been waiting for three hundred years."
  
**Figures:**
- Exact large numbers in narration: 347 pages
- Dates, times, addresses

### Dates

**Format:** Month Day, Year
> July 4, 2026

With day of week:
> Saturday, July 4, 2026

### Serial Comma

**Required in Chicago:**
> apples, oranges, and bananas

### Hyphenation

**Compound adjectives before nouns:**
> a well-known author
> a first-rate performance
> a ten-year-old boy

**After nouns:**
> the author is well known
> the boy is ten years old

## Questions for Meru

1. Do Editrix fiction projects follow Chicago strictly, or with house modifications?
2. For ellipses: spaced (. . .) or closed (...)?
3. For thoughts: italics standard, or varies by project?
4. Any specific Chicago rules you see editors getting wrong?
