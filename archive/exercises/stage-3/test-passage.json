      "Eleanor Ashworth had never expected to inherit Hartley Hall. The estate had belonged to her great-aunt, Lady Margaret Ashworth, who had died three weeks ago at the age of ninety-two. Eleanor had met her only once, at a family gathering in 1998, and remembered her as a stern, grey-haired woman who smelled of lavender.",
      "",
      "Now, driving up the long gravel drive, Elinor felt a mixture of excitement and trepidation. The solicitor's letter had been clear: she was the sole beneficiary. The hall, the grounds, and everything in them now belonged to her.",
      "",
      "Hartley hall was larger than she had remembered. The Georgian façade stretched across the hillside, its honey-coloured stone glowing in the afternoon light. She counted fourteen windows on the upper floor alone.",
      "",
      "Mrs Patterson, the housekeeper, met her at the front door. 'Miss Ashworth, welcome. We've been expecting you.' She was a small woman in her sixties, neatly dressed in a grey cardigan and sensible shoes.",
      "",
      "'Thank you, Mrs Patterson.' Eleanor stepped into the entrance hall. 'This is quite overwhelming.'",
      "",
      "'Lady Margaret loved this house,' Mrs. Patterson said, leading her through to the drawing room. 'She lived here for sixty years, you know. Never wanted to leave.'",
      "",
      "The drawing-room was magnificent—tall windows, antique furniture, and oil paintings covering every wall. Eleanor recognised a portrait of Lady Margaret above the fireplace, painted when she was young. In it, her eyes were blue, not the grey Elinor remembered from their one meeting.",
      "",
      "'Would you like some tea, miss?' the house-keeper asked. 'I can show you around afterwards.'",
      "",
      "'Yes, please.' Eleanor sat down on a velvet chaise longue. 'Mrs Patterson, how long have you worked here?'",
      "",
      "'Thirty-five years this October. I started when I was twenty-eight.' She paused at the door. 'Your great-aunt was ninety-four when she passed. A remarkable woman.'",
      "",
      "Elanor did the maths. That would make Mrs Patterson sixty-three now. She looked younger, somehow.",
      "",
      "While she waited for tea, Eleanor explored the room. The bookshelves held hundreds of volumes—first editions, she suspected, worth a small fortune. A writing desk by the window contained bundles of letters tied with red ribbon.",
      "",
      "She picked up a photograph from the mantelpiece. It showed two women standing in front of the hall: Lady Margaret and another woman, darker-haired, smiling at the camera. The back read: 'Margaret and Rose, summer 1962.'",
      "",
      "Mrs Patterson returned with a tea tray. 'That's Lady Margaret with her sister, Lady Rose. They were very close. Lady Rose died in nineteen seventy-five, very young—only forty-two.'",
      "",
      "Eleanor calculated. If Rose was forty-two in 1975, she would have been born in 1933. But the photograph was dated 1962, when Rose would have been twenty-nine. She did look young in the picture.",
      "",
      "'Lady Rose lived in the east wing,' Mrs Patterson continued, pouring tea. 'Lady Margaret kept it exactly as it was after she died. Locked the door and never went in again. Forty-eight years now.'",
      "",
      "Forty-eight years? That would mean Rose died in 1975—no, wait. 2023 minus 48 was 1975. That checked out.",
      "",
      "'I found something in the attic last week,' Mrs. Patterson said, setting down the teapot. 'Letters between the sisters. I thought you might want to see them.'",
      "",
      "The grey-haired housekeeper produced a small wooden box. Inside were dozens of letters in faded blue ink. The first was dated March 1960.",
      "",
      "'May I read them?' Eleanor asked.",
      "",
      "'Of course. They belong to you now. Everything does.' Mrs Patterson stood. 'I'll leave you to it. Dinner is at seven-thirty, if that suits you.'",
      "",
      "Elinor opened the first letter. It was from Rose to Margaret, written from London.",
      "",
      "My dearest sister, it began. I have news that I hardly dare put into words. I have met someone. His name is William, and he is everything I ever wanted. Father would never approve—he is a teacher, not the titled gentleman Father has in mind—but I cannot help what my heart feels.",
      "",
      "Eleanor smiled. A secret romance. She read on.",
      "",
      "The letters spanned two decades. Rose and William had married secretly in 1961, against their father's wishes. They had lived in London, happy but estranged from the family. Only Margaret had known, had kept their secret and visited when she could.",
      "",
      "The last letter was dated November 1974, just months before Rose died.",
      "",
      "I am ill, Rose had written. The doctors say there is nothing more they can do. I am at peace with this. I have had a good life. William is with me, and that is all I need. Please, when I am gone, tell our family the truth. Let them know I was happy.",
      "",
      "Elanor wiped her eyes. Had Lady Margaret ever told the family? Or had she kept her sister's secret to the grave?",
      "",
      "There was one more item in the box: a photograph of Rose and William on their wedding day. Rose wore a simple white dress; William was tall and dark-haired, smiling broadly. They looked blissfully happy.",
      "",
      "On the back, in Margaret's handwriting: Rose and William, June 14th 1961. The happiest day of her life.",
      "",
      "Mrs Patterson appeared in the doorway. 'I thought you might like to see the east wing,' she said. 'Lady Rose's rooms. Nobody has been in there since Lady Margaret's death.'",
      "",
      "Eleanor stood. 'Yes. I'd like that very much.'",
      "",
      "The grey-haired housekeeper led her up the main staircase and along a corridor lined with family portraits. At the end was a heavy oak door, locked.",
      "",
      "'Lady Margaret kept the key in her desk,' Mrs. Patterson said, producing an old iron key. 'I found it when we were sorting her things.'",
      "",
      "The door creaked open, releasing a scent of dust and old roses. Eleanor stepped inside.",
      "",
      "The room was frozen in time. A four-poster bed, made up as if waiting for its occupant. A dressing table with silver-backed brushes. Photographs everywhere—of Rose and William, of places they had travelled, of a life lived fully.",
      "",
      "'She never stopped loving her,' Eleanor whispered.",
      "",
      "'No,' Mrs Patterson agreed. 'She never did.'"
