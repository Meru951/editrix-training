# Marketing Plan: Editrix Academy Proofreading Course
## BookTok + Bookstagram Launch Strategy

*Prepared by Diana (Course Coordinator) & CMO*
*1 February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

We're launching a 10-day online proofreading course to book lovers on TikTok (BookTok) and Instagram (Bookstagram). 

**Core positioning:** *"Become the last person who touches a book before it goes to print."*

This isn't about "learn to proofread." It's about entering the romanticised literary world BookTok already loves — but with responsibility, not just access.

---

## 1. Positioning

### The Insight

BookTok and Bookstagram audiences romanticise the literary world. They dream of lives surrounded by books, working in publishing, being part of how stories reach readers.

We're not selling a course. We're selling *a way into that world*.

### The Hook

> *"Become the last person who touches a book before it goes to print."*

This works because it implies:
- **Insider access** — You're part of the process
- **Responsibility** — Your judgment matters
- **Trust** — Publishers rely on you

### The Proof

Our practice manuscripts use beloved classics: Austen, Dickens, Brontë, Conan Doyle, Wilde. This isn't abstract — students literally proofread *Pride and Prejudice* and *Jane Eyre*.

### The Transformation

**Before:** "I love books but don't know how to work with them."
**After:** "I just proofread a Jane Austen manuscript. I found 75 errors. I could do this professionally."

## 2. Platform Strategy — BookTok vs Bookstagram

### The Core Difference

**BookTok (TikTok):** Discovery engine. The algorithm pushes content to people who've never heard of you. High virality potential, lower intent.

**Bookstagram (Instagram):** Relationship engine. Slower growth, but followers are warmer. Higher intent when they arrive.

### Recommendation: Unified Message, Platform-Native Execution

Same positioning ("last person before print"), but different content formats.

| | BookTok | Bookstagram |
|---|---------|-------------|
| **Format** | Video-first, 15-60s, trending sounds | Carousels, Reels, aesthetic stills |
| **Tone** | Casual, direct-to-camera, quick hooks | Polished aesthetic, longer captions |
| **Strength** | Viral discovery, challenges, duets | Community building, saves, DMs |
| **Content** | "Spot the error" challenges, satisfying corrections, dream job reveals | Before/after carousels, day-in-the-life Reels, testimonial graphics |
| **Posting** | 5x/week minimum (algorithm rewards volume) | 3-4x/week (quality over quantity) |
| **CTA style** | "Link in bio" (soft) | Stories with link stickers, DM funnels |

### Platform Roles in the Funnel

1. **BookTok** = Top of funnel. Cast wide, hook with aspiration and curiosity.
2. **Bookstagram** = Middle of funnel. Nurture with proof, aesthetics, community.
3. **Email** = Bottom of funnel. Convert with urgency and detail.

Cross-post Reels to both, but create native content for each. Don't just repurpose TikToks to Instagram — the audiences feel the difference.

## 5. Assets Needed

### Video Assets

| Asset | Purpose | Specs |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **"Gasp moment" demo** | Hero content — error flagged in real time | 15-30s, vertical, satisfying sound |
| **"Satisfying corrections" supercut** | Multiple errors fixed in sequence | 30-60s, vertical |
| **"Dream job reveal"** | POV: your life as a proofreader | 30-45s, direct-to-camera |
| **Course walkthrough** | What the 10 days look like | 60-90s, screen recording + voiceover |
| **Student transformation** | Before/after testimonial | 30-60s |

### Static/Carousel Assets

| Asset | Purpose | Specs |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Before/after manuscript** | Visual proof of skill | Carousel, 3-5 slides |
| **"Spot the error" graphics** | Engagement bait | Single image or carousel |
| **Course breakdown infographic** | What you'll learn | Carousel, 5-7 slides |
| **Dark academia aesthetic shots** | Brand building | Single images, moody lighting |
| **Quote graphics** | From classic manuscripts | On-brand typography |

### Supporting Assets

- **Landing page** with clear CTA, testimonials, curriculum preview
- **Email sequence** (welcome → value → social proof → urgency → close)
- **Link-in-bio tool** pointing to course + free resources

### The One Asset That Matters Most

The **"gasp moment" demo video**. This is the flagship. It needs to show:
1. A real error in a classic manuscript (Austen, Brontë)
2. The moment of discovery
3. The satisfying correction
4. The implication: "You could do this"

If we nail this one video, it anchors the entire campaign.
