## What is BookTok?

BookTok is a TikTok community with **90+ billion views** dedicated to books and reading. It's predominantly led by young women (teens to early 30s) who share book reviews, recommendations, and bookish content.

**Key stat:** BookTok recommendations have increased book sales by up to **1,047%** (BookNet Canada data, 2019-2022).

## Why BookTok Could Work for Us

### 1. The Audience Overlap is Perfect

BookTok users are:
- **Book lovers** who dream of working with books
- **Young, ambitious** — many want careers in publishing
- **Engaged** — they comment, share, participate in challenges
- **Aspirational** — they romanticise the literary world

Our course offers: *A way into that world.*

### 2. "Behind the Scenes" Content is Huge

BookTok loves content about:
- How books get made
- The publishing process
- Industry secrets
- "Day in the life" of publishing professionals

An editing course fits this perfectly — we're showing them *how the sausage is made*.

### 3. Educational Content is Thriving on TikTok

#LearnOnTikTok has billions of views. Quick, satisfying educational content performs extremely well when it:
- Teaches something surprising
- Shows a transformation (before/after)
- Makes the viewer feel smarter

## Content Angles That Could Go Viral

### Angle 1: "Satisfying Error Corrections"

**Hook:** "Watch me fix this published book's errors in real time"

Show a PDF with highlighted errors being corrected one by one. Oddly satisfying content is huge on TikTok — watching mistakes get fixed triggers the same response as cleaning videos.

**Example video:** Split screen — messy manuscript on left, clean correction appearing on right. Satisfying sound effect for each fix.

---

### Angle 2: "Career You Didn't Know Existed"

**Hook:** *"Become the last person who touches a book before it goes to print."*

This is stronger than "get paid to read books" because it implies *responsibility*. BookTok romanticises the literary world, but the ambitious ones want to *matter* in it. "Last person before print" says: your judgment counts.

Many people don't know proofreading is a real job. The "dream job reveal" format does extremely well.

**Example video:** "Things I do as a professional proofreader" → show cosy setup, cup of tea, manuscript, red pen. Romanticise the lifestyle — but emphasise the trust placed in you.

---

### Angle 3: "Errors in Famous Books"

**Hook:** "Mistakes in books you've definitely read"

Find real errors in published bestsellers. BookTok loves feeling like insiders who know secrets about their favourite books.

**Example video:** "This typo has been in every edition of [famous book] since 1995..."

---

### Angle 4: "Can You Spot the Error?"

**Hook:** Interactive challenge content

Show a sentence. Ask viewers to spot the error. Reveal answer. Comment sections go wild with people arguing about grammar.

**Example video:** "Only 3% of people can spot what's wrong with this sentence" — engagement bait, but it works.

---

### Angle 5: "Dark Academia" Aesthetic

**Hook:** Tap into the dark academia / cosy reading aesthetic

BookTok romanticises: libraries, old books, candlelit reading, intellectual pursuits. Proofreading fits this aesthetic perfectly.

**Example video:** Moody lighting, classical music, close-up of pen marking a manuscript, leather-bound books in background. Caption: "Becoming the kind of person who edits manuscripts for a living."

---

### Angle 6: "Pride and Prejudice but make it proofreading"

**Hook:** Use classic literature we already have

Our practice manuscripts use Austen, Dickens, Brontë, Wilde — all beloved by BookTok. Lean into this.

**Example video:** "I spent 10 days learning to proofread using Jane Austen manuscripts. Here's what happened."

## Format Best Practices

### What Works on BookTok:

| **Trending sounds** | Helps with algorithm discovery |
| **Direct to camera** | Personal connection |
| **Before/after** | Satisfying transformation |
| **Challenges** | Encourages UGC and sharing |

### Video Length:
- **15-30 seconds** for hooks and teasers

## Risks and Considerations

### 1. Age of Audience
BookTok skews young (16-25). Many may not be ready for professional training. **Counter:** Position as "level up" content for the ambitious ones who want more than just reading.

### 2. Perception of Difficulty
Proofreading might seem boring or hard. **Counter:** Emphasise the satisfying, cosy, "get paid to read" angle.

### 3. Algorithm Unpredictability
TikTok's algorithm is fickle. **Counter:** Consistent posting (3-5x per week minimum), rapid iteration based on what performs.

---

## Quick Wins to Start

1. **Create a TikTok account:** @EditrixAcademy or similar
2. **Film 5 "spot the error" videos** using our practice manuscripts
3. **One "dream job reveal" video** — romanticise the proofreader lifestyle
4. **Dark academia aesthetic video** — moody, cosy, aspirational
5. **Duet/stitch BookTok creators** who mention wanting publishing careers

---

## Measurement

Track:
- Views per video
- Engagement rate (likes + comments + shares ÷ views)
- Profile visits → website clicks
- Course sign-ups attributed to TikTok

**Goal:** Build audience first, convert later. Don't hard-sell too early.

---

## Summary

BookTok is the perfect audience for our course because they already love books and dream of working in publishing. The key is to:

1. **Lead with aspiration** — "You could do this for a living"
2. **Make it satisfying** — Error corrections, before/after
3. **Stay authentic** — No corporate polish, be human
4. **Use our classics** — Austen, Brontë, Wilde = instant recognition
5. **Build community first** — Sell later

The romanticised "cosy literary life" aesthetic + the "career you didn't know existed" angle = potentially very viral combination.
