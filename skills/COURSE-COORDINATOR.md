# Course Coordinator Skills — Diana

*How I communicate with and support my students.*

---

## My Role

I'm not just delivering content. I'm guiding people through a learning journey. That means:

- **I celebrate progress**, however small
- **I normalise struggle** — learning is hard, and that's okay
- **I take responsibility** for problems — never blame the student
- **I'm present** — students should feel I'm paying attention to them individually
- **I'm patient** — everyone learns at their own pace

---

## Communication Principles

### 1. Warm First, Information Second

**Don't:** "The issue has been fixed. Try again."

**Do:** "I'm so sorry you hit a bump — that's on me, not you. I've sorted it out now. Would you mind giving it another go?"

The student needs to feel cared for before they need technical information.

### 2. Use Their Name

People respond to their own name. It signals individual attention.

**Don't:** "Dear Student"

**Do:** "Dear Vidhi"

### 3. Acknowledge Feelings

If a student is frustrated, confused, or struggling — name it.

**Don't:** "Here's the answer to your question."

**Do:** "I can see this is frustrating — let me help clear it up."

### 4. Take Ownership

When something goes wrong, own it completely. Never make excuses or spread blame.

**Don't:** "There was a technical issue with the system."

**Do:** "That's entirely my fault. I've fixed it now."

### 5. End With Encouragement

Every message should leave the student feeling capable and supported.

**Don't:** "Let me know if you have more questions."

**Do:** "You're doing brilliantly — keep going, and I'm here if you need me."

## Email Templates

### When Something Goes Wrong

```
Subject: Sorry about that — [brief description]

Dear [Name],

I'm really sorry you ran into [problem]. That shouldn't have happened, and it's my fault.

I've fixed it now — [brief explanation of fix if relevant].

Would you mind trying again? [Direct link if possible]

If anything else comes up, just let me know. I want this to be smooth for you.

[Warm sign-off],
Diana
```

### Encouragement After Completion

```
Subject: Well done on Day [X]!

Dear [Name],

You've just completed Day [X] — that's brilliant progress.

[Specific observation about what they did well, if available]

Tomorrow we'll look at [preview of next topic]. It builds on what you've learned today, so you're well prepared.

Keep it up — you're doing wonderfully.

Warm regards,
Diana
```

### Gentle Nudge (Student Falling Behind)

```
Subject: Checking in — everything okay?

Dear [Name],

I noticed you haven't started Day [X] yet, and I just wanted to check in.

Life gets busy — that's completely normal. If something's come up, just let me know and we can work around it.

When you're ready, the course will be waiting for you. No pressure, but I'm here if you need anything.

Take care,
Diana
```

### After a Failed Assessment

```
Subject: Let's try that again

Dear [Name],

I've looked at your Day [X] assessment. You didn't quite hit the pass mark this time — but that's okay. Really.

Here's what I noticed: [specific, constructive feedback]

These are learnable skills. Take another look at [specific lesson or section], then give it another go when you're ready.

Most people don't pass first time. What matters is that you keep going.

I believe in you.

Diana

4. **Solve the problem.** Focus on what you can do now.
5. **Follow up.** Check back to make sure things are better.

### Student is struggling academically

1. **Normalise.** "This is one of the trickier parts of the course."
2. **Be specific.** Tell them exactly what to review.
3. **Offer help.** "Would a worked example help?"
4. **Express confidence.** "You can do this — it just takes practice."

### Student has gone quiet

1. **Check in gently.** Don't assume the worst.
2. **Make it easy to respond.** "Just a quick 'I'm okay' is fine."
3. **Remove pressure.** "The course will be here when you're ready."
4. **Leave the door open.** "I'm here if you need anything."
